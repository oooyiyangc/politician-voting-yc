  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, is debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective 
designees.
  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Diaz-Balart) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.


                             General Leave

  Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Ohio?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Legislative Branch 
Appropriations Act.
  While this subcommittee may be small, it has a very important role. I 
very much appreciate the hard work and collegial attitude of all the 
members of this subcommittee, particularly the contributions and 
cooperation of our ranking member, Ms. Herrera Beutler.
  This is a good bill. I am proud of this bill and I am proud that it 
makes a substantial investment to expand recruitment and retention of 
staff, prioritizes funding to expand diversity and inclusion campus-
wide, and funds needed investments to support the day-to-day operations 
of the House so that we can support our constituents.
  Included within this bill is a 21 percent increase for the Members' 
Representational Allowance, which covers staff, district office space, 
and day-to-day operations for lawmakers to best serve our constituents. 
This has been a priority for me as I recognize the important role of 
expanding pay and benefits for our staff as we strive to recruit a more 
diverse workforce in our offices, and then to retain these staff, 
instead of losing them to the private sector.
  Additionally, this year's bill makes important steps in exploring 
other areas where we can expand benefits for staff to compete with the 
private sector. And so, this year's report directs the Chief 
Administrative Officer to conduct a benefit and retention study to look 
at possibilities such as tuition credits, the creation of 529 accounts, 
a House-wide leave policy, and childcare subsidies so that we can 
continue to meet the needs of existing and future staff.
  It is vital that we prioritize initiatives to expand a diverse and 
talented workforce here on Capitol Hill. The report provides an 
additional $350,000 to establish a task force within CAO to include the 
Office of Diversity and Inclusion, the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights, and any other House office as may be necessary, to 
develop a methodology for regularly surveying the House workforce on 
pay and benefit issues, to provide guidance and support for the content 
and development of a centralized human resources hub and to make policy 
recommendations.
  Additionally, while the bill continues the prohibition of cost-of-
living adjustment increases for Members, in order to ascertain all the 
facts on this issue we also require the CAO to provide a report 
comparing Members' pay with executive and managers' pay in the private 
sector who have similar levels of experience and responsibility.
  In a year full of trauma and hurt, with the apex being the 
insurrection on January 6, our human resources entities within the 
Capitol complex have adapted to the evolving and increasing mental 
health needs of our campus. The bill includes $2.3 million, a $635,000 
increase for the Office of Employee Assistance, and a $1.7 million 
allocation for the Office of Well-Being to ensure that people here on 
Capitol Hill have the resources to support the needs of our community 
and to fund culturally

[[Page H4159]]

sensitive mental health services so everyone feels comfortable seeking 
the support they need.
  We have also included $2 million for the House Modernization 
Initiatives account to build off last year's efforts to make Congress 
more effective, efficient, and transparent on behalf of the American 
people.
  Second, the bill provides $15.4 million to expand the paid internship 
program. This will increase the amount to $35,000 per Member office to 
pay interns. We have also extended this funding to committees, and 
continue to support these funds being used for interns both in D.C. and 
in district offices.
  We want to make sure that any citizen in this country, any young 
person in this country who wants to come to Washington, D.C., is able 
to do that. We are trying to eliminate those economic barriers so that 
people can come here and get the experience they need to improve their 
lot in life, and to serve their country.
  But we also recognize the ongoing inequities in congressional 
internships, so we included language directing the Office of Diversity 
and Inclusion working in conjunction with the Chief Administrative 
Office to conduct a feasibility study on recreating a centralized House 
internship program--similar to the old LBJ intern program from many 
years ago--which could provide various support services, such as 
housing, training, professional development, and focus outreach on 
students attending historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal 
colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other 
minority-serving institutions. I believe this is a vital step for us to 
create a pipeline for students from all backgrounds, all economic 
areas, to come and work on Capitol Hill.
  The bill also includes $3 million for the Office of Diversity and 
Inclusion and directs the CAO to increase their staff cap from 7 to 10 
staffers to allow them the additional workers that they need.
  Additionally, once again, this year's bill includes language to 
permit DACA recipients, Dreamers, to be able to work for Congress and 
other legislative branch agencies.
  Turning to other legislative branch agencies, the bill provides 
strong support for the security and operational needs of the House and 
surrounding Capitol complex.

  H.R. 4346 includes $600 million for the Capitol Police, which is an 
almost $90 million increase above the fiscal year 2021 bill. This 
provides vital resources for training, recruitment, retention, and 
readiness efforts. This funding will provide for a total of 2,112 sworn 
officers.
  Additionally, this continues to build off previous efforts in 
ensuring a robust trauma and resiliency program for our sworn and 
civilian officers. This is an extremely important investment as they 
continue to heal from the events of January 6 and Good Friday. And we 
saw further testimonials yesterday in the hearing as to why exactly 
this investment is needed.
  The bill includes an increase of $37 million from 2021 for the 
Library of Congress, as it is this subcommittee's duty to protect the 
valuable collections and preserve the Library's ability to chronicle 
this great Nation and provide access to our history for generations to 
come.
  And it includes $3.8 million to continue the Library's work on the 
Veterans History Project to collect and preserve the personal accounts 
of American war veterans.
  The bill also increases funding for the Architect of the Capitol over 
2021 by $152 million to address necessary construction activities, such 
as the Cannon Office Building renovation. Also included are various 
other provisions to ensure the Capitol Visitor Center and Capitol 
complex are accessible for individuals with disabilities and all 
visitors who wish to tour the Capitol or meet with their Members of 
Congress.
  And, finally, the bill includes language for the removal of statues 
or busts in the Capitol of those who tried to overthrow the Government 
of the United States or were white supremacists.
  Before I finish, I would like to recognize the staff for all their 
hard work and time they have put into this bill. From the majority 
committee staff, I would like to thank my clerk, Steve Marchese and 
Rachel Jenkins from my personal office. From the minority committee 
staff, I would like to thank Michelle Reinshuttle. And, again, to the 
Chair of the full committee, Rosa DeLauro, Ranking Member Kay Granger, 
and Ms. Herrera Beutler. This was a great team effort to put this thing 
together, and we are proud to submit it to the body today.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera 
Beutler) controls the time and is recognized.

                              {time}  1545

  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, first, let me commend Chairman Ryan for his 
cooperation on this bill. He has worked in good faith with me and my 
staff to include requests in this bill every step of the way, and I 
really appreciate it. I think it is a good model for the rest of how 
Congress should work, and I would work with him anytime. I want to say 
thank you to his staff and to the staff under Chairwoman DeLauro, Steve 
Marchese. I want to thank my staff, Michelle Reinshuttle for getting us 
to this point, although, I don't believe we are quite there yet. I am 
going to explain why.
  Madam Speaker, I have to rise in opposition to H.R. 4346, the fiscal 
year 2022 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act. This bill does include 
some provisions that I support, including critically needed funding to 
address the requirements of the Capitol complex.
  It provides funding that allows Members and our staff to better serve 
our constituents by providing better software to improve the 
accessibility of casework forms that our offices use to help 
constituents resolve problems and issues with Federal agencies. It 
implements measures to increase staff retention, and it allows offices 
to acquire new technologies to strengthen the protection and 
productivity of our IT infrastructure.
  This bill also supports the critical mission of the Capitol Police by 
providing funding for additional personnel to replenish their really 
depleted ranks, new leadership training initiatives, and additional 
resources so they can continue to protect Members, staff, and visitors 
who come and occupy the Halls of Congress on a daily basis.
  In the aftermath of an incredibly difficult and challenging year for 
the men and women of the Capitol Police, these measures are really an 
important step toward improving the police force.
  However, Madam Speaker, while there are many parts of this bill that 
I do support, this bill, like the others that the majority has put 
forward, is based on what I believe is a flawed fiscal foundation. The 
majority is forging ahead with massive increases to nondefense 
spending. The bill we are considering today includes a nearly 13 
percent increase over current levels. I am going to explain why that in 
context creates some problems. At a time of record high deficits and 
debt, we need, I believe, a more measured fiscal response.
  In addition, the majority has also included controversial policy 
riders that our side of the aisle opposes. With the approach that the 
majority is taking with this bill--and really all of them in the 
appropriations packages we are considering here today--we are on the 
path to yet another continuing resolution. If we are to break this 
cycle, our majority counterparts need to be more willing to work with 
the minority on all the bills to create a more bipartisan support that 
garners more of a bipartisan thumbs up.
  Furthermore, the majority has not put forward any of the Capitol 
Police reforms to the board that governs the Capitol Police or its 
leadership structure, and that is a real sticking point, Madam Speaker. 
Including funding to hire more officers and to get more equipment is a 
necessary step. I would go to bat for that any day of the week. We will 
never see lasting improvement to the operation of the force or officer 
morale without these necessary reforms. We are going to continue to see 
the erosion of the force until those changes are made.
  As we grapple with the trillions in new spending that the majority 
has passed and is proposing already 6

[[Page H4160]]

months into this year, I want to emphasize this point, we must course 
correct now rather than wait until our Nation has passed the point of 
no return. The Democrat majority got out of the gates by pushing 
through a $1.9 trillion package that includes bailouts for States like 
California that were already raking in billions more in State revenue 
than was previously forecast.
  My colleagues across the aisle and this administration are insisting 
on using reconciliation to force through $4 trillion more on a gigantic 
wish list.
  For perspective, the spending I outlined is above and beyond the 
normal congressional appropriations. Specifically, it is nearly four 
times what the Democrats are proposing to spend on this and these 
appropriations bills that we are considering.
  Last year when the entire Nation was grappling with COVID-related 
shutdowns, when hospitals were down to their last box of surgical 
gloves, and Congress had to step in to make sure that our health system 
and our communities didn't collapse, those were needed dollars. But we 
should not make the mistake that national emergencies like the COVID 
pandemic should green-light and invite further spending that is going 
to usher in record inflation, trillions more in debt, and, honestly, a 
reckless increase in spending.
  I fear that some here are simply not aware of how spiking the prices 
are of food, of gas, and of other everyday items impacting families. 
Unbridled spending brings on the kind of inflation that increases 
prices exponentially. When we talk about saddling the next generation 
with crushing debt, we are talking about your kids, Madam Speaker, my 
kids, and their grandkids, and they are going to have to pay for these 
decisions.
  I believe that we can do better. The funding increases in this bill I 
think are going to fuel that fire. I think we need to recalibrate.
  Madam Speaker, for all these reasons I urge my colleagues to join me 
in opposing this bill at this time, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is the chair of the full Committee on 
Appropriations.
  Ms. DeLAURO. I thank the gentleman, Madam Speaker, for yielding. I 
just might say that just as this is his first time in chairing the 
subcommittee--and congratulations--it is my first time chairing the 
full committee. So we are on the same page. I want to thank both the 
chair and the ranking member for their work on this bill.

  Madam Speaker, as the oldest modern democracy in the world, the 
United States exemplifies the success and long-term sustainability of 
democratic governance and of the great American experiment. If we fail 
in this experiment, then we fail to honor our sacred duty not only to 
our own citizens, but to America as an ideal.
  The events of January 6 threatened that ideal. The brutal, violent 
assault on our Capitol was an attack on the cradle of our democracy and 
against liberty. It was a determined and violent insurrection aimed at 
stopping the peaceful transfer of power; something that the United 
States has exemplified in its history. It was an attack not just 
against this building, but on America's example to the world.
  This bill also honors the sacrifices of the brave women and men in 
uniform who risked their lives defending this institution shockingly on 
display at the first hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol. It gives these heroes the 
funding, the resources, and the training they need to ensure what 
happened on January 6 never happens again. It also says: We respect 
what you do.
  It includes measures to provide more transparency, diversity, and 
leadership training for the Capitol Police to standardize vetting and 
routinely review staff for employment suitability, to provide for the 
wellness and the well-being of our Capitol Police.
  While securing the Capitol Police must be our top priority, we must 
also ensure the institution within these walls remains strong. I am 
proud that this bill provides increased funding for the Members' 
Representational Allowance, for standing committees, for select 
committees, and for leadership offices to help retain and recruit a 
talented and a diverse workforce. To grow opportunity and create a 
diverse hiring pipeline, it expands paid internship opportunities while 
providing the authorization for Dreamers to work in congressional 
offices.
  Together, Madam Speaker, the initiatives in this bill will not only 
protect the Congress and our democracy, they also strengthen and 
sustain it. I urge support for the bill.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), who is the distinguished ranking 
member.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
4346, the fiscal year 2022 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. I 
wish I could support this important piece of legislation, but 
unfortunately, it has too many flaws, and it does not reflect the type 
of bipartisan agreement that we must have to complete the 
appropriations process this year.
  At a time of record-high deficits and debt, now is not the time to 
double down on increasing domestic spending. This bill alone includes a 
nearly 13 percent increase over current levels.
  The bill also includes riders that are more appropriately addressed 
by authorizing committees specifically related to immigration policy.
  In addition, the committee report is loaded with unnecessary partisan 
requirements for the Capitol Police that will make it more difficult 
for them to carry out their missions. The committee report also expands 
data collection efforts on individuals working in the Capitol and 
testifying before Congress, including sensitive payroll and financial 
information. That is not the way to do business if we want to enact 
full-year appropriations bills this year.
  We must develop top-line spending levels that both sides can support, 
and we also must agree to drop controversial policy provisions. If we 
want to avoid a long-term continuing resolution or worse, a government 
shutdown, we must get serious and do the work our constituents sent us 
here to do.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
  Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Pelosi).
  Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am 
pleased to come to the floor to salute him for his leadership as chair 
of this very important subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations 
that makes things happen for us in the Capitol to do the people's 
business.
  The United States Capitol has always been a beacon of freedom, 
liberty, and justice to America and to the entire world. Here, 
lawmakers and staff, institutional workers, the Capitol Police, and 
members of the press enable the functioning of our very democracy. It 
is vital that we ensure that this institution has the funding and 
resources needed to serve the people.
  The most exciting part of it is when children come to the Capitol 
safely and curiously and excited about seeing where laws are made and 
what our Founders' vision was and what our men and women in uniform 
fight for as we see in their eyes their aspirations to the future which 
is our charge for the children.
  That is why today I am proud to rise in support of the Legislative 
Branch appropriations bill which meets these needs. I thank the 
committee chairwoman, Ms. DeLauro, and subcommittee chair, Tim Ryan, 
for their leadership. This takes a lot of attention and a lot of 
specificity and meticulous attention to detail, and I thank the 
distinguished chair of the committee for his brilliant attention to all 
of that.

                              {time}  1600

  This funding bill not only funds the legislative branch, it 
strengthens it. It does so by advancing a more diverse and inclusive 
congressional workforce. It has long been a priority for many of us to 
ensure that the Halls of the Capitol reflect the beautiful diversity of 
our Nation at every level.
  The bill provides for strong funding for paid internships to support 
more hardworking interns from middle-class families. This has been such 
a priority

[[Page H4161]]

for many of us because these internships are an opportunity for young 
people. But if they are unpaid, they already self-select as to who can 
participate. We have seen this over time, where that opportunity cannot 
be taken advantage of unless there is funding for it.
  It also provides funding for the Wounded Warrior program, which gives 
our heroes who served in uniform an opportunity to serve in 
congressional offices.
  Proudly, it allows Dreamers to work in the legislative branch. Our 
Dreamers make America more American, and it is vital that their voices 
are heard here in the Capitol.
  Most importantly, this bill is about security, and that is a moral 
imperative, funding and supporting our United States Capitol Police 
force, the heroes. In this legislation, we secured strong increases in 
funding for the Capitol Police force, which will provide for the hiring 
of over 2,100 sworn officers and 450 civilian members of the Capitol 
Police.
  It also improves training and bolsters wellness support for the 
Capitol Police, many of whom are still suffering from the January 6 
domestic terrorist attack on the Capitol complex.
  Just yesterday, we heard from four heroic members of law enforcement 
who suffered horrible injuries and trauma that day. That trauma 
continues, not just among the Capitol Police, not just among Members of 
Congress, not just among Capitol staff, congressional staff, but those 
people who maintain the Capitol, who make it all work for us, custodial 
and maintenance people in the Capitol.
  Every hero of that day needs and deserves our support. Now that the 
Senate has announced their agreement on a security supplemental, we 
will work to ensure that the need of the Capitol and congressional 
community, as completed in the Honore report, and included here, are 
met. I thank the chairman for the work that was done on that 
supplemental.
  Of course, what we sent to the Senate is much stronger than the 
response we will get from them, but we must start, and we must 
continue.
  This legislation honors our heroes. It respects our values. It 
directs removal of statues or busts in the Capitol of Confederate 
traitors, as well as statues of white supremacists.
  As I have said many times, the Halls of Congress are the very heart 
of our democracy. The statues on display should embody our highest 
ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a 
Nation.
  Removal of these statues is long overdue. That is why, as Speaker, I 
have led the passage of legislation now twice to do so. In fact, I took 
down the pictures in the Speaker's Lobby months ago as an example.
  At the same time, this afternoon, we are considering the foreign ops 
bill. I call it the foreign ops bill. When I was the ranking member it 
was called foreign ops. Now it has a bigger name and a Democratic 
chairman.
  The bill makes important investments to strengthen Congress and, 
therefore, strengthen America, and it should be passed.
  In that spirit, I also support another appropriations bill to 
strengthen America, H.R. 4373, which advances our leadership in the 
world, as it defends our values.
  As a former ranking member of the State and Foreign Operations 
Appropriations Subcommittee, I am proud of this bill, and I salute the 
chair, Barbara Lee, a lifelong champion of global health and human 
rights, including through her leadership on PEPFAR and the Global Fund 
to Fight Aids.
  This funding bill makes clear that, as President Biden has said, 
``America is back.'' It is a strong statement of America's leadership 
in the world.
  With this legislation, America is once again taking the lead in the 
climate fight, with over $3 billion to address the climate crisis, 
including through first-ever appropriations to the Green Climate Fund.
  We are setting an example for the world on public health, providing 
over $10 billion to support families' health around the world and 
prevent future pandemics, focusing on surveillance, detection, and 
response capabilities.
  Also, in terms of public health, we are proud to be permanently 
repealing the global gag rule, a dangerous rule that deprives the 
poorest families in the world of basic healthcare and family planning 
services.
  We are investing billions in initiatives for maternal and child 
health and fighting infectious diseases, including, still, HIV/AIDS 
through PEPFAR.
  This funding honors our values by investing in human rights with the 
Global Equality Fund and other initiatives to support the LGBTQ 
community and support for disability rights, gender equality, and 
protecting persecuted religious minorities; humanitarian assistance, 
with billions for migration and refugee initiatives and disaster 
assistance; and protecting democracy and the rule of law around the 
globe. It contains billions in security and economic support to 
partners and allies to advance peace, prosperity, and stability.
  We are proud of its strong support for Israel, which is in our 
national security interests.
  We are also proud that this legislation helps implement the ALLIES 
Act, passed last week by the House to expedite Afghan Special Immigrant 
Visas.
  The local Afghan partners who have worked shoulder to shoulder with 
the American military and our diplomatic personnel are heroes. They 
have been vital to the safety of American lives and the success of our 
mission. We made a promise, and now we are keeping it. We must be there 
for them as they were for us.
  These two funding bills demonstrate and defend American leadership at 
home and around the world. I urge a strong bipartisan ``aye'' vote for 
both.

  I thank the leadership of Rosa DeLauro, Barbara Lee, and Tim Ryan.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. Womack).
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text 
of the amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the 
motion to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Blumenauer). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Arkansas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit for one 
simple reason: so our defenders, the National Guard and the Capitol 
Police, can have the funding they need to continue protecting Americans 
day in and day out.
  This motion does what Congress has been unable to do for months, and 
that is support our guardsmen and our Capitol Police.
  Each and every one of these brave men and women have voluntarily 
raised their hands and sworn an oath to protect our institution and our 
country. And we can't do our most basic duty of providing funding for 
them to complete this sacred task.
  For both the Guard and the Capitol Police, this funding is essential 
to maintaining operations. We are talking about something as basic as 
keeping the lights on.
  These gaps were caused by the Capitol security mission. They came 
here to protect us, and it should be this Congress, through the 
Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, which foots the bill.
  Without this funding, the National Guard will be forced to cancel 
annual training and drill weekends through the end of the fiscal year. 
They will have to defer 75 armory and training site upgrades. The Air 
National Guard will see an 8-flying day standdown, and there is much, 
much more.
  This imperils unit readiness. That is obvious. It is also a pretty 
grave outcome. But individual soldiers and airmen, and their families, 
will see the dire impacts as well. These training cancelations will 
take an expected check out of their monthly budgets. Unlike Congress, 
these families have to operate within their means. There is no option 
for them to raise their debt ceiling.
  These guardsmen and -women are in your States, in your districts, in 
your hometowns. They volunteered to serve our country, and they did so 
with only a single expectation in mind, that Congress will have their 
backs. We need to live up to that commitment, just as they have for us.
  My MTR will also ensure the Capitol Police have the resources they 
need after the valiant efforts on January 6 and in the days since.

[[Page H4162]]

  It also provides targeted, necessary funding to enhance the physical 
security of the Capitol. Without this funding, they, too, will see 
training delays and furloughs.
  Like the National Guard, the Capitol Police are always ready and 
always there. They stand watch for us whenever we need them.
  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the progress Senators Leahy and 
Shelby have made. I hope we vote on their supplemental before we leave 
for the week.
  But let me be crystal clear: This should have been accomplished the 
day after we learned of the Guard and Capitol Police budget shortfalls. 
Instead, we have let silly partisan games and unrelated provisions 
leave our defenders high and dry.
  To my colleagues, when you come to the floor later to vote on this 
MTR, and you put your voting cards in the machine, I want you to think 
about the guardsmen in your hometown, the cop, the teacher, the small 
business man who put on the uniform to defend us and protect us at home 
and abroad. I want you to think about that person and commit to 
supporting them and to supporting their family.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my motion to recommit.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Just a quick 
response, Mr. Speaker.
  We have passed a bill, the rescue package, that sent billions of 
dollars to the local communities to pay for police, fire, and first 
responders, State support for teachers. We passed a supplemental bill 
out of this Chamber that reimbursed the National Guard and made huge 
investments into the Capitol Police. In both instances, we didn't get 
one Republican vote.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
Hoyer), our distinguished leader.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for making that point, 
although I am somewhat sorry because I was going to make the same 
point. But I am going to make another point.
  First of all, let me say to those who may be watching, the gentleman 
who just spoke from Arkansas is one of my best friends in the Congress. 
He is a wonderful, wonderful person. He is dead flat wrong, however, in 
this assertion.
  His motion will not give a single cent to the National Guard, not a 
single cent to the police, not a single cent to anybody.
  All it will do is send the bill back to committee. It will delay this 
bill to do all the other things that it does from being enacted.
  It is sad that the Republicans in the Senate haven't passed a single 
appropriation bill. And, golly day, it took a long time to get them to 
some agreement on the supplemental, and then, when they agreed on the 
supplemental, they left the money for the National Guard out.
  So, I say to my friend from Arkansas, who is my dear, dear friend and 
a wonderful person, your amendment, with all due respect, first of all, 
as you know, is not going to go anywhere. All you will do is return the 
bill to committee and slow this process down and not give a single cent 
to the National Guard or policemen, either Capitol Police or any other 
police. That is the reality.
  Now, I wanted to rise and speak on behalf of this bill. I want to 
thank the chairman, Mr. Ryan, and I want to thank my good friend, who 
is also another dear friend of mine. Unfortunately, sometimes people 
think everybody dislikes one another. I happen to like the gentlewoman 
who is the ranking member, who is, I think, one of our best Members in 
the House on your side of the aisle.
  I know that this is a difficult bill in some cases for your side of 
the aisle.

                              {time}  1615

  I have been here a long time. We just honored Jerry Lewis, who was 
the gentleman from California who had your position and had the 
chairman's position. He was back and forth. They came to this House in 
a bipartisan way to say, let's build this institution into the kind of 
institution that Americans want.
  That is what this bill does. This bill gives us the opportunity to 
hire, retain, and pay competitively our staff, who are extraordinary 
people. The American people are getting more than their money's worth 
with our staff, because they are extraordinarily able people, well-
educated people, experienced people, who make a difference for America. 
This bill seeks to compensate them, not as much as they get in the 
private sector, but competitively, at least with the executive 
departments, so the executive departments are not taking all of our 
people. That is reason enough to be for this bill.
  Now, there is something in this bill I don't like, and no other 
Member probably will come to this floor and say it. Members of the 
Congress of the United States have not received a cost of living 
adjustment--forget about a raise--a cost of living adjustment since, I 
believe, 2009, for 11 or 12 years. And this bill says, oh, we are not 
going to take one this year either.
  Now, let me tell you something. The result of this irresponsible 
demagogic action--and I don't say any personal aspersions on anybody--
is that only rich people will be able to serve in the House of 
Representatives.
  Now, very frankly, I live alone. My wife died. I am in good shape. I 
don't need the COLA. It will make no difference in my life. But there 
are a lot of people who come to this Congress with three or four 
children, and they have got to open a second residence, either rent or 
buy here, and keep a residence at home, and they are struggling.
  I know it doesn't sound like you are going to struggle at $174,000. I 
don't blame people who are making $60,000, $80,000 who say: What do you 
mean you are struggling?
  But the fact of the matter is, all I ask is, keep us even. Don't give 
us a raise. Just keep us even. As the cost of living goes up, just keep 
us even in terms of our purchasing power.
  I am going to vote for this bill, but I sure don't like that 
provision. Now, we Democrats have put it in; the Republicans have put 
it in. I get it. I get the politics of it.
  But I will tell you, for a long period of time I worked with Trent 
Lott, with Tom DeLay, with Roy Blunt, and with other Republican 
leaders--I seem to be the one that has been here consistently working 
on this--to make sure that at least 50 percent of us on each side voted 
to give us a COLA, to keep us even, so that we did not expect people 
who had their housing costs go up, their healthcare costs go up, their 
educational costs for children go up, to be frozen.
  It is tough on families. It is not tough on me, so I am not arguing 
from a personal standpoint. Very frankly, I am just fine.
  But I say this because I want the public to know that there is at 
least someone who is saying: Look, the job is worth it. You may not 
think we are worth it, but the job is worth at least keeping even.
  But this is a good bill. I am going to vote for it. There are 
provisions in other bills that I don't like, but I vote for them, 
because on the whole, I think this is an excellent bill for this 
institution and for the American people.
  I urge everybody to vote ``yes.''
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to speak on the motion to recommit that the 
gentleman from Arkansas offered. I know it sounds like, with the 
majority, we are just going to have to agree to disagree on this.
  I think that there are a lot of good things in this bill that I 
support. But the biggest challenge for me, having spent this year, like 
the rest of us, trying to help our families, our constituents move on 
through COVID, help our small businesses survive, and then starting off 
this year in the manner that we did and recognizing the impact on not 
just the Capitol campus, but the men and women who protect us, the 
Capitol Police, I really feel like in this bill, the Legislative Branch 
appropriations, there needed to be some significant reforms to some of 
the failures in response that we experienced.
  Now, I know that there are other efforts, not related to this bill, 
that are looking at other actors, other players. I am setting all of 
that aside because I don't have control over that. But I do have a say 
here, with my voting card, on the Legislative Branch appropriations 
bill.
  What is frustrating to me--and I heard, you know, my good friend from

[[Page H4163]]

Ohio and the Speaker mention: Well, we did this supplemental and put 
all of this other stuff in here for the Capitol Police. Well, there are 
things that were left out of that supplemental that are so crucially 
significant to reforms that will help prevent another January 6, and 
they are in the motion to recommit.
  Let me explain a couple of those. One of those that we have in the 
Republican motion to recommit is a reform to the Capitol Police Board. 
We know that there was a major failure and breakdown in communication 
on the Capitol Police Board, which inhibited the response, the 
coordinated, collective response of the law enforcement here.
  Talk to any police officer who bravely defended us, and they will 
tell you that they weren't getting clear directives in their 
headpieces. They will tell you that the coordination effort from the 
leadership broke down, and they were doing everything they could on the 
front lines themselves. So a rational response to that would be: Why 
did that break down and what can we do to fix it?
  One of those things is to provide oversight, congressional oversight, 
over that Capitol Police Board by requiring that board, who made those 
decisions, who left a lot of our police officers on their own, to meet 
together in front of congressional committees, the committees of 
oversight.

  As it stands now, we can't get the entire police board together in 
one room for a hearing. The gentleman and I--on Legislative Branch 
appropriations--we got to meet with different members of the police 
board in different hearings at different times. It was helpful. But to 
really correct the problem--and when you ask each of them: Where was 
your failing on January 6? They all do this--or they did this. There 
are now new actors in there.
  But I look at the function of that board, and I think, okay, common 
sense would be to put the Architect of the Capitol, the two Sergeants 
at Arms, and the Capitol Police chief all on a witness panel in front 
of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee or the House 
Administration Committee or the Senate Rules Committee.
  That wasn't in your supplemental, that is not in this Legislative 
Branch appropriations bill, or in any of President Biden's rescue 
plans. We do throw a lot of money at it, but we are not fixing a 
structural, fundamental problem that helped complicate our response.
  Our motion to recommit fixes that. It simply changes the language, 
and it requires them to come before the committees of jurisdiction 
together and answer questions of oversight capacity from Members of 
Congress. That is a simple fix. It shouldn't be partisan. It is not in 
the underlying bill, and it should be. Our motion to recommit does 
that.
  Another thing that we do in our motion to recommit to improve the 
underlying bill is, we require an improved and streamlined response, 
and we give that authority to the Capitol Police chief to call in the 
National Guard on a quick, developing emergency.
  One of the things that we heard in the aftermath of January 6 was he 
said, she said. I called them in, they said they couldn't come. This 
person said they couldn't come. I mean, we just got very convoluted 
responses into why the National Guard wasn't here quickly.
  Again, I recognize there are other efforts looking into other actors 
on that front. I am not getting into that. What I am talking about is 
what we have control over right here.
  The underlying Legislative Branch bill does not improve that 
streamline process. In fact, it leaves in place the process whereby the 
chief of police has to go through this bureaucratic, arcane process to 
get permission from every member of that board before they can respond 
to an immediate emergency and request the National Guard. Well, that 
was part of the problem on January 6.
  Our motion to recommit fixes that. It says that the Capitol Police 
chief, in an emergency, a quick, developing emergency, can call in the 
National Guard and have the authority to request them to come. It also 
has a failsafe in there that says, if the Capitol Police Board gets 
their act together and meets quickly and sees the issue differently, 
they can rescind that authority. But what it does, it is an opt-in. 
Automatically, the police chief has authority to call in the reserves 
when there is an emergency.
  Just like you see where a chief in a major metropolitan area has the 
authority to call in things, and then they are accountable to the mayor 
or to the city council, but they have that authority. Right now the 
Capitol Police chief doesn't have that authority, that was a problem on 
January 6. Unfortunately, if this bill passes as it is, it will still 
be a problem today, 7 months later.
  Again, there are things in the underlying bill that I like and 
support, but it is like having the salt for your steak, but you don't 
actually have the beef. You have got to have that sizzling steak and 
you add the salt to it and it is a wonderful meal. That is how I look 
at this.
  We do want to put the money forward to make sure that we are adding 
to the force and we are putting in training programs and that is in 
this underlying bill. Those are good things. But we have to change the 
fundamental flaws with how the Capitol Police Board operates.
  This is the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. This is the 
appropriate place. I would have yielded if the House Administration 
Committee wanted to do that. Had they done it, you wouldn't hear me 
piping up about it, but they haven't. It needs to be done so that we 
are taking responsibility for failures here on our campus that we can 
correct. So I urge adoption of the motion to recommit.
  One more thing that I think is really significant, and this is where 
I differ from the gentleman from Maryland, who I also have great 
respect for, is the underlying bill talks about pay and making sure 
that we are adding more police officers to the force. I am there every 
day of the week and twice on Sunday. The problem is, they are going to 
hit a cap.

  So when a police officer, which we saw in January, February, March, 
they would work their regular hours, and then because they were short-
staffed and there weren't enough officers on the force, they would be 
called to work overtime. They are accruing that overtime, and at some 
point, they will have earned too much money to get paid all of it 
because there is a cap in law that says they can only make so much.
  The underlying bill does not fix that cap. However, our motion to 
recommit does. Our motion to recommit removes that cap so that those 
officers who are owed that overtime, because they worked their tails 
off weeks on end, will be able to get that pay and not risk being 
furloughed as we get to the end of the year.
  Again, there are good things in the underlying bill, but it is not 
quite good enough. We can make it better. We can make it better by 
adopting the motion to recommit.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume for the purpose of closing.
  Again, I just want to say it has been a privilege to be in this 
process.
  You know, it is ironic to me, because the Legislative Branch 
appropriations bill is generally one that significantly only impacts 
the Capitol community. I serve an amazing district in southwest 
Washington, 2,500-plus miles away from this campus. Generally, the 
Legislative Branch appropriations bill isn't high on their radar, until 
this year, until we saw that there are events and there are actors who 
we are going to have to protect against.
  We are going to have to protect the guests and the visitors. This is 
the people's House, and I want the people from my district to have the 
right and the trust to come here and feel safe, to be able to have 
their voices heard. That is why this bill went from kind of being one 
that most people didn't pay attention to, to a lot more attention, a 
lot more front and center.

                              {time}  1630

  It is such an honor and privilege to get to work on this because I 
believe, in a very strong spirit of bipartisanship, we can make sure 
that we are lifting up and girding up the Capitol Police force, making 
sure that the Sergeant at Arms is working together

[[Page H4164]]

with the Architect of the Capitol to ensure the safety and continuity 
of the work of the people's House.
  This is the Constitution in action. It is a privilege to get to work 
on this. I think that we can improve this underlying bill. I think that 
we need to adopt the motion to recommit. I think we need to introduce 
some of these ideas so that we can stave off a continuing resolution in 
the eleventh hour.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the motion to recommit, and in its 
absence, I do believe we need to send this bill back in order to get it 
completely right. I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to 
close.
  This is a good bill, and we have put a lot of work into this bill. 
The essence of the Legislative Branch appropriations bill is an 
understanding that everybody that works on Capitol Hill is a public 
servant.
  The Capitol Police, those on the dais, the people who clean the 
offices, the people who do all of the construction, the young staffers, 
the middle-age staffers, the older staffers have spent sometimes 
decades trying to make this government run and help this government 
run.
  This bill is an opportunity for us to continue to invest into those 
people, making sure that they can stay here, they can work here, they 
have competitive wages, competitive benefits compared to the executive 
branch, compared to the judicial branch, compared to the private 
sector; and also knowing and understanding that we have an obligation 
to protect this Capitol.
  That is what we have done in this bill. We have made increases to 
Members' allowances so that they can maintain their staff and the 
talent that they have. We are making sure that we have a paid 
internship program here so that some young person from Youngstown, 
Ohio, or some small town or city across the United States can actually 
take advantage of the opportunity to stay for a summer or semester in 
one of the most expensive housing markets in the whole United States.
  I am very proud of the investments we are making in this bill. I am 
proud of all of the efforts to protect this Capitol, the first branch 
of our democracy, and I am very much looking forward to voting on this. 
This will provide the needed funding for the day-to-day operations of 
the House. I urge all Members of this body to support this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

     Capitol Police to enforce the prohibition on the use of 
     scooters on the United States Capitol Grounds.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
Herrera Beutler) each will control 10 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.
  The amendments en bloc include a number of proposals offered by my 
Democratic colleagues. It reflects our shared values of investing in a 
more diverse congressional workforce, strengthening the legislative 
branch, and providing for the day-to-day operations of the House.
  I urge my colleagues to support the important proposals contained in 
this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. Kelly).
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Center for Audit Excellence and its mission in supporting and assisting 
auditing organizations domestically and internationally.
  A part of the Government Accountability Office, the Center for Audit 
Excellence provides training and assistance to auditing organizations, 
fostering accountability from local governments in the United States 
and foreign governments across the globe.
  One of the Center's most essential missions is aiding supreme audit 
institutions of nations that receive U.S. foreign assistance. This 
helps instill good governance and ensures that U.S. tax dollars are 
being used efficiently.
  Currently, the Center for Audit Excellence is funded almost 
exclusively by fees. They do not have dedicated funding and must rely 
on USAID missions or local and foreign governments approaching them for 
their services. Providing dedicated funding will allow for the Center 
to have more predictable budget cycles and will expand their reach in 
helping governments establish sound audit practices.
  Not only is there a need for dedicated funding, but there is also a 
need for more funding at the Center for Audit Excellence. Providing 
more funding will expand the Center's global footprint and reach more 
countries' supreme audit institutions. This critical funding would help 
ensure that governments around the globe and here at home in the United 
States have the training and assistance to strengthen oversight 
capacity and reduce government waste.
  Helping to build auditing capacity cuts down on government corruption 
and promotes good governance. Within the U.S., enhanced auditing 
capacity

[[Page H4165]]

strengthens local government practices so they better respond to their 
citizens' needs. Internationally, greater auditing capacity helps low-
income and developing nations increase accountability and the 
responsible use of public funds.
  The United States provides billions of dollars of foreign assistance 
each year, and even more is sent to State and local governments. 
Providing dedicated funding for the Center for Audit Excellence will 
help ensure that U.S. tax dollars are spent wisely and as intended.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. McCarthy), the minority leader.
  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendments and 
to this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, earlier today the Speaker of the House said that people 
who are fully vaccinated but don't support wearing a mask are morons. 
She went on to say that the House should follow the science.
  Madam Speaker, you don't know the facts nor the science, so let's 
talk about it.
  The Speaker is referring to the CDC current recommendation. I just 
left speaking with Dr. Monahan from the House. He said he used the CDC 
recommendation on a report that hasn't been printed yet. He did not 
know that the report is based upon India, about a vaccine that is not 
approved in America. And now he did not know that it didn't even pass 
peer review.
  That is why vaccinated people in this House now have to wear a mask. 
There is no science. But I guess the Speaker must have not known that.
  Why wouldn't the Speaker know the facts? Do you know what frustrates 
Americans the most? Hypocrisy. They hate the idea that you tell people 
if you get vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask. First, they tell 
us don't wear a mask, wear a mask, wear two masks, then take the mask 
off.
  They said if Americans got vaccinated, we would get our lives back. 
And we did, thanks to Operation Warp Speed and the past administration.
  But what they also hate about hypocrisy is when you break your own 
rules. It is kind of like telling America you can't go get your hair 
cut, but you get caught on camera because you do it. Or you tell people 
you can't go out to dinner, but in my same State, the State that the 
individual got the haircut, that Governor went out to dinner with a lot 
of people.
  Today the Speaker, who didn't know her own science and said names to 
people, broke her own rules. Twice today I saw the Speaker in a crowded 
room without a mask, less than 24 hours after imposing the mask 
mandate, which, again, is not based upon a study. It is based upon a 
study in India, based upon a vaccine that isn't approved in America, 
and it didn't pass peer review.
  Could this be a plan to try to keep our schools closed?
  Worst of all, this administration and now this House has broken the 
country's trust. One size fits all.
  You know, if you read the CDC recommendation, it said you only should 
wear the mask for the hot spots. I am sure the gentleman on the other 
side knows which States and which cities are hot spots, because those 
are the facts. You can see the facts. You can read the facts. You can 
understand the facts.
  So what is Washington? The vaccination rate for the Members of 
Congress is over 85 percent, and as of today the transmission rate on 
the Capitol campus is less than 1 percent. Well, the facts will tell us 
this isn't a hot spot, so the CDC recommendation doesn't apply to us.

  Meanwhile, the hospitalization rate for the people who are vaccinated 
is 0.003. As Washington Post columnist Henry Olsen points out, you are 
more likely to get struck by lightning than be hospitalized with the 
vaccine. It must be a stormy day in the House.
  You know what is interesting? We serve in this Chamber, we represent 
our districts, and we have Senators who represent our States just down 
the hall. The science based upon the Speaker of this House changes 
somewhere around the rotunda.
  You see, you have to wear your mask here, otherwise you are fined; 
because that is what government should do, they should punish people. 
You get vaccinated. But if you walk across the hall, you get somewhere 
around the rotunda, you don't have to wear it anymore. Somehow the 
science is different.
  One thing we do know about COVID, it affects older people different 
than younger. Facts tell us people who serve in the Senate on average 
are older than the people in the House. But the science and the health 
over there is different than in here.
  It is interesting, too, because I remember a short time ago when we 
had the mask mandate during one of the impeachments the Democrats 
brought up, the managers wore their masks here, but as they walked to 
the Senate, they were able to take them off.
  I am not quite sure how much COVID lives on this side of the 
building. That must be science. That must be what the Speaker was 
talking about.

                              {time}  1645

  The past administration worked hard for Operation Warp Speed. I am 
proud of the fact of what we voted for. When we brought up bills on 
this floor that talked about working toward a vaccine, that is where 
the money went, not the trillions of dollars that were wasted that now 
gave us inflation.
  Americans want to get back to work, back to school, and back to 
health. But we now have a majority that doesn't want to base anything 
on science. They want to base something on a report that is not 
printed, that can't pass peer review, based upon the country of India, 
based upon a vaccine that is not even approved in America, because the 
facts and the science are that the vaccines in America work. They are 
effective. They are free.
  I got a vaccine in December. I recommend all Americans get a vaccine.
  It is a concern we all have. We go every day trying to get more 
people vaccinated. What do you think the message is today? Those who 
run this side of this building believe now if you are vaccinated, you 
have to wear a mask even though the science doesn't say you should. I 
am not sure how many more people are going to rush to get vaccinated.
  But it is just like their philosophy. They want to mandate. They want 
to impose. They want to tell you when you can go to school, when you 
can eat.
  Do you know what they are going to do if you walk into this building 
without a mask? They are going to charge you $500. Why? Because they 
have the power to do it.
  You walk across the hall, not quite sure where they morph it into a 
different science, you don't have to.
  Mark my words, this is just the beginning. In a few weeks, schools 
are supposed to open again. We know what the science says about COVID 
with children. I think you are going to start seeing new reports. They 
won't be printed, but they will try to keep the schools closed.
  Maybe if I whisper, the President will listen. He tries it.
  Then, they will try to shut our businesses down one more time. 
Operation Warp Speed provided vaccines that were tested, that worked, 
that are effective. The study, the science, proves it so. The 
hospitalization rates prove it so.
  I don't know of one person in this Chamber that is going to get 
struck by lightning today. But I do know, even though the odds are 
better you get struck by lightning than being hospitalized if you are 
vaccinated, we are all going to have to wear a mask, or we have to pay 
$500.
  I don't know, the gentleman over there is going to run for the 
Senate. Maybe he wants to do that so he doesn't have to wear a mask. 
The science over there is better.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Takano), the distinguished chairman of the Veterans' 
Affairs Committee.
  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for 
yielding. I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this en 
bloc, which includes a symbolic amendment in support of the Office of 
Technology Assessment, otherwise known as OTA.
  The reestablishment of OTA has been a top priority of mine since I 
first came to Congress in 2013. Since then, debates around emerging 
technologies and concepts have caught this Congress by surprise as we 
struggle to legislate on

[[Page H4166]]

complex issues of technological and societal importance.
  Before OTA was defunded in 1995, the office served a critical role in 
providing Members of Congress and staff with nonpartisan and expert 
advice on complex scientific and technical issues. OTA served as a 
model of good governance and innovation in government, and believe me, 
we could use OTA now in this environment of dissembling and shading of 
the truth around vaccines.
  Today, OTA would be invaluable as we debate issues related to 
cryptocurrencies; nonfungible tokens, or NTFs; cybersecurity; 
artificial intelligence; and other developing technologies throughout 
our society.
  We understand the importance and value of CRS and GAO when it comes 
to researching and understanding complex issues. That is not up for 
debate. Yet, OTA is necessary to ensure Congress is informed and 
knowledgeable on some of the most complex issues facing our society 
today.
  Staff who will work alongside CRS and GAO to provide this expertise 
will help this legislature not only catch up with the rest of our 
economy but truly understand how these new forms of technology affect 
our economy in everyday life.
  The foundation of good policy is accurate and objective analysis, and 
the reestablishment of the Office Technology Assessment is how we will 
pass new and forward-thinking laws for our country.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 5\1/4\ minutes remaining.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  I am prepared to close on this bill, but since my name was invoked, I 
want to make a couple of comments to what the minority leader was 
saying, maybe much to the chagrin of staff who is here.
  Fear, fear, fear. The Attending Physician of the United States 
Capitol, the top doctor for Congress, asked us to put on masks when we 
come to a Chamber with 435 people. I hate these things. It is 
absolutely terrible having to put this back on. We do it because the 
top doctor for all of us asked us to.
  I may not be from a hotspot. The Speaker may not be from a hotspot. 
Speaker Pelosi may not be from a hotspot. Somebody in this Chamber is 
coming from a hotspot. Somebody represents the hotspots. They get in a 
plane, and they fly here, and they interact with all of us. Then, we 
leave here, and we go home to our families. Some take care of their 
sick parents. Some take care of kids who may have an autoimmune 
disorder.

  I find it absolutely immature and appalling to somehow diminish it to 
try to score cheap, political points. That is exactly what we saw a few 
minutes ago. That is beneath a minority leader of one of the major 
political parties in the United States of America, saying we should 
take no caution that someone from a hotspot is working in this Chamber 
and could potentially get someone infected that could go home to a sick 
parent or an immunocompromised kid.
  That is beneath us, and it is certainly beneath leadership here in 
Washington, D.C.
  I am sorry, I had to comment on that because it is very frustrating. 
We are dealing with a complicated pandemic, a new strain, and we are 
trying to figure everything out.
  The Attending Physician says, since you are a group from all over the 
country, be a little bit cautious. And he gets mocked. This is the 
doctor we all go to. You are denigrating the Attending Physician? Has 
it gotten this bad here? We will be the first ones to go down there 
when we are sick, need an antibiotic, or to get a checkup.
  I mean, come on. Stop. Just stop with this craziness. We are trying 
to be safe. We are trying to protect our family members, our kids, our 
parents, close relatives.
  The minority leader mocks that and mocks the top doctor, who has a 
very distinguished record and a very distinguished career and spends 
his life making sure we are healthy. It is shameful.
  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendments en bloc, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that

8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


          Amendments En Bloc No. 2 Offered by Mr. Ryan of Ohio

  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 567, I rise as 
the designee of the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) to offer 
amendments en bloc.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendments en 
bloc.
  Amendments en bloc No. 2 consisting of amendment Nos. 6, 10, and 12, 
printed in part B of House Report 117-110, offered by Mr. Ryan of Ohio:


           Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Graves of Louisiana

       Page 7, line 1, after the dollar amount insert ``(increased 
     by $100,000) (reduced by $100,000)''.


        Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Langevin of Rhode Island

       Page 20, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced 
     by $3,504,000)''.
       Page 20, line 13, after the first dollar amount, insert 
     ``(increased by $3,504,000)''.


           Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Raskin of Maryland

       Page 6, line 22, after the first dollar amount, insert 
     ``(increased by $100,000)(reduced by $100,000)''.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
Herrera Beutler) each will control 10 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.
  Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.
  The amendments en bloc include a number of proposals by my 
colleagues. This is a bipartisan amendment.
  It includes funding to prioritize the removal of accessibility 
barriers on the Capitol complex, conduct a study on security risks and 
technical limitations of the Capitol switchboard system, and provides 
for a collaborative drafting program to help Members' offices work 
better with the House Office of Legislative Counsel.
  I urge my colleagues to support the important proposals contained in 
this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to the 
amendments.
  Madam Speaker, I specifically call out the gentleman from Rhode 
Island's amendment. It increases funding by $3.5 million for the 
Capitol Grounds account, and it is offset within the bill. The intent 
of these funds is to be used to prioritize the removal of accessibility 
barriers on the Capitol complex.
  I am thrilled about this amendment. Parts of this building and the 
surrounding complex were built over 100 years ago, so, obviously, there 
are accessibility issues that today we are saying we are going to 
remove those barriers.
  I commend both of the bipartisan amendments in the amendments en 
bloc. I urge Members to please support it. I think this does good work.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the en bloc 
which includes my amendment, #10, to increase funding for the Capitol 
Grounds account to prioritize the removal of accessibility barriers.
  Madam Chair, the Capitol Complex was not built with accessibility in 
mind, and as the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress, I'm reminded 
of this every day.
  For the past two decades, I've worked closely with the Architect of 
the Capitol to address these barriers, and I'm grateful for the 
progress we've made so far. Yet many physical barriers still remain, 
and we need to remove them proactively so that all Members of

[[Page H4167]]

Congress, our staff, and visitors from across the nation can navigate 
the Capitol with ease.
  I thank Chairman Ryan and the Legislative Branch Subcommittee for 
including report language under the Capitol Grounds account directing 
the Architect of the Capitol to prioritize the removal of accessibility 
barriers.
  Yet the reality is, proactively achieving this requires dedicated 
funding, which is what my amendment provides. l thank the Chair and 
Ranking Member for supporting it, and I urge my colleagues to support 
the en bloc and the underlying bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. DeGette). Pursuant to House Resolution 
567, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered 
by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.
  Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I have offered this en bloc for purposes of 
legislative efficiency. I strongly oppose it.
  This amendments en bloc makes severe and harmful changes to the bill 
under consideration. This amendment would strike language that will 
enable noncitizens who meet requirements under DACA to be employed by 
the United States Congress and to cut funding from the Office of 
Diversity and Inclusion.
  Let's address the first point around DACA.
  This is allowing Dreamers to work for the legislative branch. I can't 
figure out for the life of me why the minority would like to refuse the 
American Dream to people who came to the United States as children, for 
people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans.
  I have met these recipients, these Dreamers, and they have personally 
told me their stories. I encourage each of my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to talk with a Dreamer, to listen to their stories. It is 
absolutely heartbreaking. They have done absolutely nothing wrong.
  They were brought to this country by no choice of their own. Their 
parents brought them here. The United States is their home. They have 
built their lives here, whether that means getting an education, 
raising a family, or contributing to our economy.
  We are a generous and compassionate Nation always looking to form a 
more perfect Union, a country that has empathy for a struggling family 
in a new country, in a country that lifts up our younger generation so 
that they can have a better future.
  The vast majority of Americans overwhelmingly support allowing these 
young people to continue their relentless pursuit of the American Dream 
because they knew in their hearts that they are American. As Americans, 
there is no better place for them to continue to serve their country 
than here in the United States House of Representatives, the people's 
House. To deny them this opportunity is about the most un-American 
thing we could do here today.
  Madam Speaker, again, their parents brought them here, and they have 
been here for years and years and years. They should have an 
opportunity to give back to this country.
  Madam Speaker, I am opposed, on the second point, to decreasing 
funding for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion by $1.5 million.
  The Office of Diversity and Inclusion is committed to maintaining a 
diverse and inclusive workforce in the House of Representatives. Their 
mission is to assist in developing practices to recruit and retain a 
diverse workforce.
  I am proud of this year's bill. It provides $3 million for the office 
in fiscal year 2022 and increases their staff cap from 7 to 10. The 
$1.5 million in additional funding for 2022 and expanding staff cap 
would give them the needed funding to support ongoing operations while 
providing additional flexibility to expand their work.
  Additionally, this increase in funding will enable ODI to implement 
various other provisions that are included in the Legislative Branch 
bill, such as assisting the Chief Administrative Officer in the Office 
of Congressional Workplace Rights to establish a task force about the 
workforce in the House.
  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this task force will develop a 
methodology for regularly serving the House workforce on pay and 
benefits issues and provide guidance to us on how we could create a 
centralized human resources hub to improve human resource management 
practices throughout the House.
  Finally, this increase in funds will allow the Office of Diversity 
and Inclusion to conduct a feasibility study on re-creating a 
centralized House internship program. We have citizens in this country, 
young students--White, Black, Brown--who can't afford to come here to 
work. They can't afford to get an internship here. They work hard, do 
everything right, try to climb the ladder. We want to provide 
opportunity.
  This money will help reach out to those people and bring them into 
the legislative branch to give them the experience they need, the 
contacts they need to develop, the education that they need to move 
forward.
  Madam Speaker, I am proud of what we have in this bill, and I will 
oppose this amendment. It is vital we prioritize initiatives to promote 
diversity and the opportunity for people from all over the country to 
come work in the legislative branch and intern in the legislative 
branch.
  Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendments en bloc, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ``no.''
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as part of this en bloc, we have two 
separate amendments. I will address them separately.
  The one amendment that was just addressed concerns DACA recipients 
and whether they should be hired here.
  In 2018, we had 830,000 Americans sworn in to be new citizens. I 
don't think anybody can accuse the United States of being shy about 
letting other people in this country.
  Obviously, if we make permanent the policy that any young person who 
is brought here automatically can work their way to be a United States 
citizen, we will have what we currently see at the southern border. We 
will have, again and again and again, parents coming here either asking 
for asylum or sending their children here by themselves, knowing that 
we are not going to enforce the immigration laws.
  Now, I think everybody here knows that the day will probably come 
where something is done with some DACA recipients, but it shouldn't be 
all DACA recipients. The idea of establishing right now that if you 
came here, you automatically are--I think the inference is you are 
going to become a citizen by saying that you can work in the Capitol 
when these jobs are highly in demand for many of our own citizens is a 
little ridiculous.
  One of my amendments removes the provision that says that people who 
are still in this country illegally can wind up working for the 
legislature.
  The second amendment concerns the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. 
I think the gentleman from Ohio kind of mischaracterized the amendment. 
We

[[Page H4168]]

are not cutting anything here. We are leaving things in the same place 
they were in the last budget.
  We have spent money in the last 12, 14 months of this institution 
like never before. We went through trillions of dollars. That is one of 
the reasons why we have such high inflation, one of the reasons why 
young people are going to find it so difficult to buy a house compared 
to the older generation, one of the reasons why the cost of food is up.
  We cannot, as we go line by line through this budget, create a 
situation in which we are doubling lines in the budget. That is what we 
are doing here.
  The other things that are particularly irritating about this, if you 
go through the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, almost all the things 
they purport to do are done somewhere else in the legislative branch. 
They are really not adding a lot.
  Obviously, it is one of these groups that I think is going to train 
people to view themselves not as individuals but more as a group, which 
I don't think is helpful for America as a whole. But, again, after 
going so overwhelmingly in debt, we have a Legislative Branch budget 
that is up 13 percent.
  It would be interesting to ask how many Americans out there, how many 
of their individual salaries or compensation went up by 13 percent in 
the last year. But for Congress, no big deal.
  Legislative Branch is up 13 percent, House Office of Diversity and 
Inclusion doubled. On its face, preposterous. I bet if you polled the 
American public, I wonder if there are any lines in this budget they 
want doubled, but particularly in an agency that, like I said, their 
function can be dealt with by other groups.
  Madam Speaker, in any event, I encourage passage of this en bloc and 
the two amendments.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``no'' vote, and I yield back
