     this section, the Secretary shall--

       ``(I) conduct an ROI analysis of the proposed assistance 
     that shows that the assistance will result in a net positive

     assistance by the date that is 10 years after the date of the 
     award of the assistance;

     amount of the Federal financial assistance.
       ``(II) Recovery.--If the Secretary makes a negative 
     determination under subclause (I), the Secretary shall 
     recover from the covered entity the difference between the

     covered entity under this section and the revenue collections 
     by the Treasury generated as a direct result of the Federal 
     financial assistance.

     term of the agreement of a covered entity required under
