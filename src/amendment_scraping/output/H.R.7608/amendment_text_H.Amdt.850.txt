     reimbursement of such taxes, and that can reasonably 
     accommodate such assistance in a programmatically responsible 
     manner.
       (e) Determinations.--
       (1) In general.--The provisions of this section shall not 
     apply to any foreign government or entity that assesses such 
     taxes if the Secretary of State reports to the Committees on

     arrangement that is providing substantial reimbursement of 
     such taxes; or

     for tax purposes that will be accorded the United States 
     assistance provided under that agreement.

     reprogramming shall be subject to the regular notification 
     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations: Provided

     Agency for International Development that are specifically 
     designated for particular programs or activities by this or 
     any other Act may be extended for an additional fiscal year 
     if the Secretary of State or the USAID Administrator, as 
     appropriate, determines and reports promptly to the 
     Committees on Appropriations that the termination of 
     assistance to a country or a significant change in 
     circumstances makes it unlikely that such designated funds 
     can be obligated during the original period of availability: 
     Provided, That such designated funds that continue to be 
     available for an additional fiscal year shall be obligated 
     only for the purpose of such designation.

                     arab league boycott of israel

       Sec. 7036.  It is the sense of the Congress that--
       (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary 
     boycott of American firms that have commercial ties with 
     Israel, is an impediment to peace in the region and to United 
     States investment and trade in the Middle East and North 
     Africa;
       (2) the Arab League boycott, which was regrettably 
     reinstated in 1997, should be immediately and publicly 
     terminated, and the Central Office for the Boycott of Israel 
     immediately disbanded;
       (3) all Arab League states should normalize relations with 
     their neighbor Israel;
       (4) the President and the Secretary of State should 
     continue to vigorously oppose the Arab League boycott of 
     Israel and find concrete steps to demonstrate that opposition 
     by, for example, taking into consideration the participation 
     of any recipient country in the boycott when determining to 
     sell weapons to said country; and
       (5) the President should report to Congress annually on 
     specific steps being taken by the United States to encourage 
     Arab League states to normalize their relations with Israel 
     to bring about the termination of the Arab League boycott of 
     Israel, including those to encourage allies and trading 
     partners of the United States to enact laws prohibiting 
     businesses from complying with the boycott and penalizing 
     businesses that do comply.

                         palestinian statehood

       Sec. 7037. (a) Limitation on Assistance.--None of the funds 
     appropriated under titles III through VI of this Act may be 
     provided to support a Palestinian state unless the Secretary 
     of State determines and certifies to the appropriate 
     congressional committees that--
       (1) the governing entity of a new Palestinian state--
       (A) has demonstrated a firm commitment to peaceful co-
     existence with the State of Israel; and
       (B) is taking appropriate measures to counter terrorism and 
     terrorist financing in the West Bank and Gaza, including the 
     dismantling of terrorist infrastructures, and is cooperating 
     with appropriate Israeli and other appropriate security 
     organizations; and
       (2) the Palestinian Authority (or the governing entity of a 
     new Palestinian state) is working with other countries in the 
     region to vigorously pursue efforts to establish a just, 
     lasting, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that will 
     enable Israel and an independent Palestinian state to exist 
     within the context of full and normal relationships, which 
     should include--
       (A) termination of all claims or states of belligerency;
       (B) respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, 
     territorial integrity, and political independence of every 
     state in the area through measures including the 
     establishment of demilitarized zones;
       (C) their right to live in peace within secure and 
     recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force;
       (D) freedom of navigation through international waterways 
     in the area; and
       (E) a framework for achieving a just settlement of the 
     refugee problem.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     the governing entity should enact a constitution assuring the 
     rule of law, an independent judiciary, and respect for human 
     rights for its citizens, and should enact other laws and 
     regulations assuring transparent and accountable governance.
       (c) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (a) if the 
     President determines that it is important to the national 
     security interest of the United States to do so.

     apply to assistance intended to help reform the Palestinian

                                TITLE IX

                   MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE

     SEC. 9001. SHORT TITLE.

       This title may be cited as the ``Middle East Partnership 
     for Peace Act of 2020''.

     SEC. 9002. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) Economic development in conflict settings has been 
     shown to support stabilization by empowering entrepreneurs, 
     growing the middle class, and mitigating unemployment.

[[Page H3748]]

       (2) In 2018, unemployment in the Palestinian territories 
     was 32.4 percent. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the 
     Palestinian territories declined from 2017 to 2019, and it is 
     projected to further decline in 2020.
       (3) According to the World Bank Ad Hoc Liaison Committee's 
     April 2019 Economic Monitoring Report, ``to achieve 
     sustainable economic growth, in the Palestinian territories, 
     growth and job creation going forward will need to be private 
     sector driven''.
       (4) According to the 2018 Joint Strategic Plan of the 
     Department of State and the United States Agency for 
     International Development, ``assistance can help prevent new 
     recruitment to terrorist organizations, reduce levels of 
     violence, promote legitimate governance structures that 
     strengthen inclusion, and reduce policies that marginalize 
     communities''.
       (5) Although economic development is an important tool for 
     stabilizing conflict-prone settings and establishing 
     connections between communities, economic development by 
     itself will not lead to lasting peace. People-to-people 
     peace-building programs further advance reconciliation 
     efforts by promoting greater understanding, mutual trust, and 
     cooperation between communities.
       (6) While the United States and its international partners 
     continue to support diplomatic and political negotiations 
     between the representatives of the parties to the Israeli-
     Palestinian conflict, such efforts require broad popular 
     support among the people on the ground to succeed.
       (7) Achieving sustainable, high-level agreements for 
     lasting peace in the Middle East must come through, and with 
     the support of, the people who live there, and the United 
     States and its international partners can help the people of 
     the region build popular support for sustainable agreements 
     for lasting peace.

     SEC. 9003. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) building a viable Palestinian economy is central to the 
     effort to preserve the possibility of a negotiated settlement 
     leading to a sustainable two-state solution with the 
     democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized, 
     democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace, 
     security, and mutual recognition;
       (2) United States and international support for grassroots, 
     people-to-people efforts aimed at fostering tolerance, and 
     building support for a such solution, can help counter 
     extremist propaganda and the growing issue of incitement;
       (3) strengthening engagement between Palestinians, 
     Israelis, and through people-to-people peace-building 
     programs can increase the bonds of friendship and 
     understanding;
       (4) investing in the development of the Palestinian economy 
     and in joint economic ventures can advance multiple sectors 
     to the benefit of local, regional, and global parties; and
       (5) Congress encourages cooperation between Palestinian, 
     American, and Israeli business sectors in order to benefit 
     the Palestinian, American, and Israeli peoples and economies.

     environment with educator presence and academic facilities 
     comparable to the Bureau-funded school, comply with all 
     applicable Tribal, Federal, or State health and safety 
     standards, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and 
     demonstrate the benefits of establishing operations at a 
     satellite location in lieu of incurring extraordinary costs, 
     such as for transportation or other impacts to students such 
     as those caused by busing students extended distances:  
     Provided, That no funds available under this Act may be used 
     to fund operations, maintenance, rehabilitation, construction 
     or other facilities-related costs for such assets that are 
     not owned by the Bureau:  Provided further, That the term 
     ``satellite school'' means a school location physically 
     separated from the existing Bureau school by more than 50 
     miles but that forms part of the existing school in all other 
     respects.

     defined in section 4(e) of that Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)); or

  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.


                             General Leave

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This minibus combines four bills: State and Foreign Operations; 
Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA; Interior, Environment; and 
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.
  The package is the product of months of thoughtful deliberation and 
input from Members on both sides of the aisle. I am proud of the work 
we have completed under the incredibly difficult circumstances of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
  This appropriations package addresses urgent national priorities. I 
would like to highlight a few of our key successes that our cardinals 
have secured: strong funding and protections to help put nutritious 
food on people's tables during this time of economic crisis and rising 
food insecurity; increased investments in broadband to connect more 
Americans to work, school, healthcare, and family; robust funding to 
protect the environment and build resilience to climate change; and 
$12.5 billion in emergency funding to address sharply rising veterans' 
healthcare costs.
  I am proud that the package also includes strong emergency 
appropriations to confront coronavirus and support economic recovery, 
with investments in critical infrastructure and coronavirus 
preparedness, response, and relief domestically and globally.
  Turning to the State and Foreign Operations division, it is 
bittersweet to bring my last State and Foreign Operations bill to the 
floor before I retire. As subcommittee chairwoman or ranking member for 
two of my three decades here, I am honored to have been entrusted with 
this responsibility on this bill that has been a key component of 
United States foreign policy since World War II.
  The work of the subcommittee has been marked historically by 
bipartisanship, and I thank former Chair and Ranking Member Hal Rogers 
and former Chair and Ranking Member Kay Granger for their partnership 
to advance this vital legislation each year.
  Pivotal moments, from September 11th to the devastation the 
coronavirus pandemic continues to cause, underscore the significant 
value of foreign aid. It promotes freedom and democracy and supports 
global development and security, all of which increase stability and 
mitigate threats to Americans here at home.
  Indeed, our own children and grandchildren are more secure as a 
result of the United States' foreign assistance that has made the world 
better, safer, and healthier for generations, efforts that are 
continued in the fiscal year 2021 State and Foreign Operations bill we 
consider today.
  With a total of $65.87 billion, it rejects the President's go-it-
alone approach to foreign policy. The bill includes $47.85 billion in 
base funding, $8 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds for 
base requirements that otherwise would not be funded by the President's 
budget request, and $10.018 billion in urgently needed coronavirus 
emergency funding to mitigate COVID-19's impact on our health and 
economy.
  To ensure this pandemic does not derail decades of development gains, 
this bill provides $3.8 billion in base funding for development 
assistance. This includes $975 million to increase access to basic 
education, of which not less than $150 million shall be spent on girls' 
education in areas of conflict.
  It effectively addresses food insecurity, poor water and sanitation 
services, trafficking in persons, and other long-term development 
objectives.
  The bill's holistic approach to global health seeks to bolster low- 
and middle-income countries' management of health threats and 
communicable diseases.
  It would sustain progress against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria 
with $5.93 billion for global HIV/AIDS activities, including $1.56 
billion for the Global Fund, for which it clarifies the United States' 
commitment to our 33 percent share.
  It also reverses the President's global gag rule, stops 
counterproductive restrictions on family planning and health funding, 
and includes $805.5 million for family planning services, of which 
$55.5 million is for the United Nations Population Fund.
  The bill provides restoration of funds for the World Health 
Organization to ensure American influence in an organization critical 
to the development and distribution of vaccines.

                              {time}  1415

  To address policies of the administration that harm our neighbors and 
drive migration, the bill amends prior-year appropriations acts to 
significantly limit the President's ability to redirect assistance 
outside of the region.
  It also maintains robust funding for counternarcotics and law 
enforcement efforts in Colombia, Mexico, Central America, and the 
Caribbean; includes $68 million to address international organized 
crime; and maintains funding to combat cybercrime.
  The bill provides $9 billion for security assistance to key allies 
and partners with support for programs in Eastern Europe, Jordan, and 
Tunisia. It keeps the commitments of the United States at Camp David to 
promote peace in the Middle East by providing $3.3 billion in aid for 
Israel's security as well as assistance for Egypt.
  It restores humanitarian and development assistance to Palestinians 
with resources to organizations working in the West Bank and Gaza, and 
it advances a bipartisan priority, with $50 million to fund a new 
partnership for peace that would strengthen economic development and 
engagement between Palestinians and Israelis. It includes $7.83 billion 
in refugee and disaster assistance, including to Latin America, the 
Middle East, Asia, and Africa.
  Additionally, the bill prioritizes the security of diplomatic and 
development staff and facilities with $6.071 billion for embassy 
security, which is $692.2 million above the President's request.
  To effectively engage allies and reclaim our leadership role, this 
bill reaffirms our support for international partners and multilateral 
organizations, which extends the impact of our assistance, and 
facilitates delivery of urgent aid to mitigate human suffering.
  Lastly, to combat the destabilizing and persistent threats posed by 
climate change, the bill provides funds in this and prior acts to 
support multilateral efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It 
also strengthens conservation and environment programs and continues 
funding for adaptation and renewable energy programs at prior-year 
levels.
  This bill reflects our common belief in the absolute necessity of 
effective diplomacy, global engagement, and robust development 
assistance to protect our own national security even as we address 
moral imperatives beyond our own borders.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my subcommittee staff who have worked in 
difficult circumstances to prepare the bill, including Majority Clerk 
Steve Marchese; staff Craig Higgins, Erin Kolodjeski, Dean Koulouris, 
Jason Wheelock, Marin Stein, Jean Kwon, Clelia Alvarado; Minority Clerk 
Susan Adams; Jamie McCormick; Austin Gage of Ranking Member Rogers' 
congressional staff; and finally, Wendy Coursen, Kelly Healton, Dana 
Acton,

[[Page H3791]]

and Elizabeth Stanley in my congressional office.
  Mr. Speaker, I express my gratitude to more past staff members and 
fellows than we have time to name today who have supported my work on 
the subcommittee. They are:
  Matthew Traub, Beth Tritter, Howard Wolfson, Clare Coleman, Jean 
Doyle, Jenny Luray, Scott Fleming, Mark Isaac, Heather Howard, Jim 
Townsend, Chris Bigelow, Lucy Heenan, Ann Vaughn, Talia Dubovi, Liz 
Leibowitz, Sonali Korde, Joe Weinstein, Brigid Otieno, Mark Carrato, 
Mark Lopes, Barbara Feinstein, Dennis Vega, Cortney Dunn, Megan Oates, 
Jennifer Munoz, Karen Larson, Ashley Quarcoo, Ralph Falzone, Mark 
Murray, Nisha Biswal, Michele Sumilas, and Michael Marek.
  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge support for the bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7608, the first 
package of fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills to be considered by 
the House. I wish the circumstances were different and I could support 
this very important piece of legislation that funds many key programs.
  This bill supports the veterans who have honorably served our 
country, the diplomats who promote American businesses and our values 
around the world, the farmers and ranchers who put food on our tables, 
and the custodians of our parks and public lands who protect our 
national treasures.
  Unfortunately, I am not able to support this bill before us because 
it has some fatal flaws.
  First, there are many policy provisions similar to the partisan 
legislation the majority has pushed through the House the last few 
months.
  Second, the spending levels exceed the amounts the Congress and the 
President agreed to just last year.
  While I acknowledge the hard work Chairwoman Lowey and her staff have 
done under very difficult circumstances, these bills do not reflect the 
way our committee typically does its business.
  Instead of building consensus with Members on our side of the aisle, 
these bills contain policy and funding proposals that appear to have 
been dictated from the top down. For example, the bill jeopardizes our 
security by prohibiting funds from being used to address the crisis on 
our southern border and by restricting the President's ability to 
respond to a national emergency.
  Provisions are included that would permanently prevent any 
administration from implementing reforms to programs that help lift 
many Americans out of poverty.
  The bill reverses course on nearly all of the language that was 
negotiated last year in the State, Foreign Operations bill to protect 
life. It does away with current policies that stop foreign 
organizations from receiving funds if they provide abortions.
  I am also disappointed to see that longstanding provisions aimed at 
enhancing transparency at the United Nations were removed. These 
conditions have made an impact on these agencies, and they should be 
continued.
  There are also new directives added that would jeopardize America's 
energy independence, and instead of rolling back burdensome 
environmental regulations to help America's businesses, this bill 
prevents many commonsense policies from being put in place and takes 
out key provisions from prior years.
  The bill also contains billions of dollars in emergency spending. $15 
billion is included for infrastructure.
  Even though the Appropriations Committee has held more than 100 
hearings and briefings this year, these proposals were never formally 
considered, and there were no discussions with Members on our side of 
the aisle. This is disappointing.
  Another $10 billion is included to address coronavirus, even though a 
$3 trillion bill passed the House in May and the Senate is planning to 
consider that bill in the next few weeks.
  In addition, $12.5 billion of veterans funding is unnecessarily 
designated as emergency, even though it was known that this spending 
would be needed when the budget agreement was enacted last year.
  We must work together on appropriations bills that avoid 
controversial legislative language and meet agreed-upon spending 
levels. This is the only way to get bills through the House and the 
Senate and signed into law.
  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this package, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies.
  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding me the time, and I rise in support of H.R. 7608.
  As chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am pleased to 
highlight the national priorities that are funded in the division that 
is covered in this bill.
  First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our distinguished ranking 
member, Mr. Fortenberry. I hope he is not getting too embarrassed by my 
endless thanks and praise, but it is really genuine.
  Drafting legislation can be complicated, but we have been able to 
maintain an open line of communication, and I am proud of our 
bipartisan relationship. We have produced a good work product that 
makes important investments that will improve the life of every 
American.
  Our fiscal year 2021 allocation is almost $24 billion, 2 percent 
above the fiscal year 2020 and more than $4.1 billion above the budget 
request.
  The bill provides $3.2 billion for rural development initiatives to 
fund critical infrastructure, such as water and wastewater systems, and 
rural housing needs.
  The bill also funds the ReConnect Program at $990 million, which is 
an increase of $435 million, or 78 percent. I am extremely proud of the 
investments that we make to close the digital divide. The coronavirus 
pandemic has made everyone aware of just how important it is for 
students and workers to be connected to the internet, and our bill 
reflects that.
  The bill, once again, includes the 10-20-30 antipoverty formula for 
Rural Development programs that is designed to target much-needed 
Federal resources to rural communities in need. Persistent-poverty 
communities for too long have suffered from neglect, and this provision 
will assist in reversing that and help these communities to thrive.
  The bill provides $1.83 billion for farm production programs. I am 
particularly proud of the $33 million in loan authority that will help 
resolve ownership and succession of farmland issues, also known as the 
``heirs' property'' issue, which predominantly affects Black farmers 
and has led to the loss of millions and millions of acres of privately 
held farmland for over a century.

  Since the beginning of the pandemic, hunger has become a new reality 
for millions of Americans, and our bill fully funds the SNAP, child 
nutrition, and WIC programs to meet the expected participation in 
fiscal year 2021.
  We also provided a big boost, $45 million, 18 percent, to the 
Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which serves the elderly poor.
  Our bill also blocks two unconscionable SNAP rules. The Able-Bodied 
Adults Without Dependents final rule and the Standard Utility Allowance 
proposed rule are both designed to restrict program eligibility.
  The bill provides $3.3 billion for agricultural research to ensure 
that America retains its role as the leader of global agricultural 
science. That number includes an increase of $29.5 million for programs 
that support the 1890 land-grant institutions.
  We rejected the administration's proposed elimination of the Food for 
Peace and the McGovern-Dole programs. Respectively, we provide $1.775 
billion and $235 million for these programs, which is an increase 
totaling $65 million, to ensure that American agriculture remains an 
essential tool of diplomacy.
  The Food and Drug Administration is funded at $3.2 billion in 
discretionary funding, the increased funding dedicated to new 
initiatives that would advance influenza vaccine technologies and 
enhance the safety of medical products and the Nation's food supply, 
especially in light of COVID-19.
  The bill also gives the FDA the authority to require mandatory 
recalls of

[[Page H3792]]

unsafe prescription and over-the-counter drugs. This is the same 
authority that the FDA already has to recall unsafe foods, infant 
formula, vaccines, and medical devices, a need that has become 
increasingly apparent in the past few weeks.
  The bill also funds the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at $304 
million, which is the same as the administration's request.
  Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of this division of the minibus, 
and I am supportive of the whole package. I urge my colleagues to 
support it.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my personal staff, Michael Reed and Maya 
Solomon; and the subcommittee staff, Martha Foley, Diem-Linh Jones, 
Perry Yates, Joe Layman, Randy Staples, Justin Masucci, and our intern 
Xavier Roberts for their hard work on the bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I also thank Tom O'Brien of the minority staff of the 
subcommittee as well as the minority staff of the full committee, and a 
special thanks to our majority clerk, Shalanda Young, for her steady 
hand in leading the majority full committee staff.

                              {time}  1430

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. I yield the gentleman from Georgia an additional 30 
seconds.
  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Granger 
for her hard work and her commitment and her public service.
  Finally, I want to say a special thank you to Chairwoman Lowey. This 
is likely to be her last Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, and it has 
been a tremendous pleasure and honor working with her. We will miss 
her. But Americans and people all over the world are better for her 
many years of service to this Congress.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the former chairman of the full committee, and 
ranking member of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
Subcommittee.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, my 
ranking member, for yielding this time; and I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 7608, the first appropriations measure to be considered by the 
House for fiscal year 2021.
  The measure before us today, Mr. Speaker, includes four of the 12 
annual spending bills. Specifically, it would provide funding for the 
Departments of State, Agriculture, Interior, as well as Veterans 
Affairs, and their related agencies and programs.
  As ranking member of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs Subcommittee, I want to again offer my sincere thanks to 
Chairwoman Nita Lowey for her collaboration. Her decision to lead this 
subcommittee, as well as being chairman of the big committee, the full 
committee, is a testament to her dedication to improving lives around 
the globe.
  She has been a tremendous partner in that venture for many years, and 
we will deeply miss her leadership of our committee and of this 
subcommittee. But I assure you, Madam Chair, we will continue this work 
in your memory because you have invested so much of your life in this 
subcommittee.
  Division A, the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill for 
fiscal year 2021, includes $55.85 billion in non-emergency 
discretionary funding, and $10 billion in emergency funding for global 
coronavirus response, for a total of $65.87 billion.
  Within that total, the bill includes funding for many key priorities 
that are critical to our national security. Chief among them is $3.3 
billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel and continued funding 
at the current level for our close partners in the region, including 
Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia.
  I am also pleased that the bill maintains funding at the current 
level, as has been said, for embassy security. The attacks on our 
embassy in Baghdad this year were a stark reminder of how we must do 
everything we can to support the safety of our foreign service officers 
working abroad.
  I appreciate the Chair continuing funding to combat the flow of drugs 
into this country and to tackle transnational crime overseas. Overdose 
deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl have spiked with COVID-19's 
growth, so we have got an epidemic now of increased overdose deaths 
within the pandemonium that is going on as well. These international 
efforts go hand-in-hand with the work we do here at home in the 
relentless fight against drug abuse and addiction.
  Elsewhere in the bill, Divisions B, C, and D of this package include 
some notable areas of bipartisanship worth highlighting. I was pleased 
to see robust funding for clean and reliable water systems and rural 
broadband service, which are vitally important in my Kentucky district.
  The bill also continues funding for the Abandoned Mine Land Pilot 
Program, a crucial economic and community development tool for regions 
like mine that were devastated by the war on coal.
  The bill also provides critical resources to take care of our 
veterans, another welcome inclusion, given their great service to our 
Nation.
  While I admire the chair's leadership in guiding this legislation 
through committee under the most challenging circumstances, I simply 
cannot support the measure in its current form.
  Our committee has a proud tradition of bipartisanship and working 
together to fund and enhance shared priorities. However, this bill's 
unchecked emergency spending and partisan policy riders give me great 
concern, and ensure it has no hope of becoming law in its current form.
  Sweeping measures that threaten the sanctity of life, like those that 
overturn the President's expanded Mexico City policy and weaken the 
longstanding protections against coercive abortion and forced 
sterilization, known as Kemp-Kasten, are the most concerning and 
controversial.
  Also problematic are ill-advised investments, including the 
international climate funds like the Green Climate Fund, which 
jeopardizes American jobs.
  Despite some areas of agreement, the unrestrained spending and 
partisan riders require my opposition to the package. I therefore urge 
my colleagues to oppose the bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I 
congratulate her for her work over the years. She and I spent over 2 
decades serving together on that committee, the Appropriations 
Committee, and the same amount of time serving on the Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of that 
Appropriations Committee; and I enjoyed her insight and her wisdom and 
her hard work, and I thank her for what she has done for the committee 
and what she has done for the country.
  I also want to thank the Staff Director of the committee, Shalanda 
Young, who clearly is one of the most outstanding members of the 
Congressional staff on either side of the Capitol. She has been 
tireless in working with Mrs. Lowey to bring bills to the floor and, 
particularly with respect to our response to COVID-19, has performed 
extraordinary services.

  Frankly, but for the Appropriations Committee and its staff on both 
sides of the aisle, we would not have been able to do that; so I thank 
all those involved.
  Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat infamous, I suppose, on my side of the 
aisle with some other committee chairs and staff, for wanting to make 
sure that we do our work on appropriation bills.
  Frankly, there are so many important bills that this House and Senate 
pass and the President signs. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case 
lately, but usually is the case. But these bills must pass.
  If the American people are going to continue to enjoy the services of 
their government, in so many critical ways to their lives, then the 
Appropriations Committee must do its job. We have been blessed that we 
have as chair and ranking member two Members who care about that 
process in Mrs. Lowey and Ms. Granger.
  I also had the opportunity of serving some period of time with Ms. 
Granger on the Appropriations Committee. She is a woman and 
Representative that I have great respect for and appreciate

[[Page H3793]]

her attitude and collegial effort to work together.
  I regret that these will not be bipartisan bills. Frankly, I think it 
is not so much because of the appropriations bill as it is because of 
the context in which we find ourselves in Washington, and in our 
country today.
  The House is getting its work done for the people, and passing these 
appropriations bills well in advance of the end of the fiscal year, as 
we did last year.
  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Senate is on track to fail to mark up 
a single bill in committee, which may be the first time ever that that 
has been the case.
  Sadly, it is consistent with their not passing any other bills 
either, so 275 of our bills sit untended in the United States Senate. 
Why?
  Because, as former appropriator and former Senate Budget Committee 
Chair Senator Judd Gregg said: ``I don't see any reason why they should 
go to markup if the goal of that markup is to simply create political 
fodder for the election, rather than move the bills forward.''
  That bleak assessment speaks directly to the harmful effects of 
Senate Republicans' policy choices, because in this body, and in the 
Democratic Caucus, we believe appropriations bills are a statement of 
our values and an opportunity to communicate them to the American 
people.
  We have a saying, all of us, put your money where your mouth is. And 
if you don't do that, then your mouth is articulating things that you 
may not really believe in, but you think it is useful for people to 
hear.
  This package contains important and positive investments in our 
people, our economy, and in our national security that reflect House 
Democrats' commitment to governing for the people and, very frankly, I 
think, for the most part, Republican values, which is why I am so 
disappointed that this will not be a bipartisan effort.
  It reflects our priorities for moving America forward and helping our 
people get ahead.
  This bill will help ensure that children and families receive the 
assistance they need through SNAP and WIC to protect against hunger, an 
extraordinary challenge in today's COVID-19-afflicted America.
  It strengthens our conservation efforts and ensures a cleaner 
environment. And we passed an extraordinary historical bill yesterday 
in a bipartisan fashion to accomplish that objective as well.
  In particular, I am pleased it includes funding for the Chesapeake 
Bay program, so vital to my State and to our region.
  We are taking steps as well to protect the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, and this package will require that the National Park Service 
will move any commemorative displays honoring the Confederacy, so that 
no American will be either humiliated or denigrated as they visit our 
national parks.
  The bill also ensures we provide resources to support our veterans, 
so critical, and across the board, felt to be a moral responsibility. 
We are standing with our servicemembers by prohibiting, frankly, the 
President from stealing funds from our military in order to build this 
wall that he said the Mexicans were going to pay for. Nobody believed 
it then; nobody believes it now. And he is taking money from our 
troops, from our military security, to build that wall.

                              {time}  1445

  I am proud that this bill continues America's strong and robust 
support for our ally Israel.
  In all, this is a funding package of which our country and this House 
can be proud. It reflects our values and our principles, and it is 
focused on governing responsibly and spending taxpayer resources 
wisely.
  Sadly, it will, in all likelihood, join the more than 275 other 
bipartisan House bills languishing in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
We have a lot of new judges; we just don't have legislation for the 
people.
  I urge the Senate to do its part to avoid even the risk of another 
shutdown. Just a few 18 months ago, 19 months ago, we came into this 
Congress with much of the Government of the United States shut down 
because the previous Congress had not funded the government. I urge the 
Senate to do its part. Let's get the job done together for the people.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair, I thank the ranking member, I thank 
the staff on both sides of the aisle, and I thank Shalanda Young.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Carter), who is the ranking member of the Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about division D of H.R. 7608, the 
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for 
fiscal year 2021.
  Throughout my time in Congress, I have focused on three things: 
soldiers, their families, and veterans. It is an honor to serve as the 
ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that has their 
interests in the forefront of our minds.
  Overall, I strongly support the funding provided for military 
construction projects. I am pleased the bill includes funding for the 
services' unfunded priorities: privatized military housing, resilient 
and energy-efficient installations, and cleanup of contaminated sites.
  On a bipartisan basis, the bill increases funding for women veterans, 
mental health and homeless programs, and supports construction of new 
VA facilities.
  Veterans have earned special attention for their service and 
sacrifice. In many ways, this bill helps to fulfill our promises to 
them.
  However, unfortunately and regretfully, I must express my opposition 
to H.R. 7608. Less than a year ago, we agreed to the 2019 Bipartisan 
Budget Act. I believe it is irresponsible to designate some funding as 
emergency just to avoid the caps set by that act. This is especially 
true since we all acknowledged the growing costs of veterans' 
healthcare programs when we agreed to the budget deal.
  I recognize the budget realities we face, but we should not unravel 
that agreement through this year's appropriations process. I am also 
concerned that this bill includes provisions that limit the President's 
ability to address the national emergency on our southern border.
  Regardless of one's position, the fact remains that cartels and 
criminal gangs take advantage of our political disagreements and 
continue to flood our Nation with dangerous and illegal drugs and 
exploit and traffic men, women, and children seeking a better life. 
This is unacceptable.
  While I oppose the final passage of the bill, I believe that the 
committee can continue to work together to fund programs important to 
soldiers, their families, and veterans in a responsible manner.
  In closing, I would like to thank my subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. 
Wasserman Schultz, for her dedication to our subcommittee and its 
responsibilities. Also, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her 
service and leadership in this Congress, and I want to thank Ranking 
Member Granger for her support and commitment to enacting responsible 
spending bills.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the distinguished chair of the 
Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the fiscal year 2021 
Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Thank 
you to my partner in this, Ranking Member Joyce, for his collaboration 
and partnership throughout this process. I am grateful for the 
leadership of Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger.
  Last year, House Democrats secured significant new investments in 
environmental protection and land conservation. This bill builds on 
those successes to advance priorities of American families, ensuring 
that we have clean air and clean water to protect our children's 
health. We protect our most special places and endangered species and 
take meaningful actions to address climate change.
  The subcommittee recommends a total of $36.8 billion in discretionary 
funding, an increase of $771 million over last year's enacted level.

[[Page H3794]]

  The bill also includes $2.4 billion in fire cap adjusted funds for 
suppression operations.
  The bill includes an additional $15 billion in emergency-designated 
infrastructure investments. These investments will increase access to 
quality healthcare and education and help clean up contaminated lands, 
polluted water, and unhealthy air.
  With yesterday's passage of the Great American Outdoors Act in fiscal 
year 2021, the Land and Water Conservation Fund will be fully funded at 
$900 million, the first time this has happened in over 40 years.
  I thank all of our constituents for making this passage a reality.
  Back to this bill. We reject the dangerous policies and funding cuts 
proposed by the Trump administration. Instead, we move forward by 
investing our resources in ways that keep our communities safe and 
healthy. We invest in protection and preservation of our landscapes and 
our biodiversity.
  I am particularly proud that this bill includes protections for our 
Nation's most visited wilderness, the Boundary Waters. It will put a 
halt to the use of funds in the next fiscal year to review or approve 
mine plans in the watershed of this treasured wilderness.

  But let me be clear: The operations of the current taconite mines of 
Minnesota's iron ore range are not impacted. There are no iron mines 
with plans under review. But there is a foreign-owned mining 
conglomerate with a plan under review for a toxic copper-sulfide ore 
mine on the doorstep of the Boundary Waters. The Trump administration 
cannot be trusted to conduct this environmental review.
  Multiple Cabinet members pledged in congressional hearings to 
complete a mineral withdrawal study within this very watershed. 
Instead, they abandoned the congressionally directed environmental 
review after 20 months, 4 months from completion, and they refuse to 
release results.
  This bill seeks to protect the Boundary Waters from an administration 
that has shown a lack of transparency, respect for science, or the 
ability to follow our Nation's environmental laws.
  Our subcommittee continues its nonpartisan approach to issues facing 
our Native American brothers and sisters. We provide $3.5 billion for 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education, and the 
Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, and $6.5 billion to 
the Indian Health Service. This is another step in the right direction 
toward upholding the Federal Government's trust and treaty obligations, 
but the work continues.
  The bill contains provisions related to ending the use of Confederate 
symbols on our public lands. Confederate flags and memorials have long 
been symbols of oppression and discrimination, and I am committed to 
doing everything we can to help this country confront and heal its 
legacy of racism. This is not about erasing our history, but it is 
about whether we are willing to do the hard work that is needed to 
confront the truth of our history and to work to right past wrongs.
  This is a good bill that works to tell the history of our country, 
even though sometimes it is painful to do so. It is a good bill that 
strives to use our natural resources wisely to protect our air, our 
water, and our land and to clean up those places that have been 
polluted in the past. This bill embraces conservation and the judicial 
use of our public lands, and yes, at times, it seeks to showcase the 
beauty of our natural resources that have been given to us by our 
creator.
  This is a good bill, and I encourage Members of this House to support 
it.
  I want to thank staff on both sides of the aisle for their hard work, 
including Rita, Jocelyn, Kusai, Janet, Peter, Donna, Tyler, Kristen, 
Darren, and Rebecca Taylor on my personal staff.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), who is the ranking member of the 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Granger 
for yielding. But first, let me acknowledge the service of our chair, 
Mrs. Lowey. I am so grateful for her graciousness, friendship, and 
especially the extraordinary example the gentlewoman sets in working 
with Ranking Member Granger, for the shepherding of our great 
committee. I thank the gentlewoman so much for her service.
  I also want to thank my good friend, Chairman Bishop, for the close 
working relationship that we have developed. Chairman Bishop has worked 
very hard to accommodate the many requests from our side of the aisle. 
I really value the constructive manner in which he was able to express 
his perspective, and we were able to work together toward constructive 
outcomes.
  The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that this bill largely reflects the 
cooperative spirit of the agricultural community in America as well as 
this committee.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, if I could divert for a moment, I want to tell a 
little story. My daughter Christine is 17. She got up at about 4:30 
this morning. Blurry-eyed, she made her way over to a local parking 
lot, got on a bus, and went about 30 miles into a cornfield where she 
and many other young people begin to pick the tassels off the corn, 
fighting off rash and insects.
  They work most of the day until it is too hot to work anymore. She 
will come home tired and exhausted, and tomorrow, she and others will 
get up and do it again and again.
  This is a rite of passage in Nebraska. It is called detasseling. What 
it does is it creates this beautiful, lifelong lesson for young people, 
connecting effort to reward and the satisfaction of a job well done.
  So it is with the farmer, Mr. Speaker. Agriculture, in so many ways, 
both provides and unifies, and that is why I am proud to be ranking 
member of the subcommittee.
  Whatever policy differences we may have, particularly over budgets or 
transitional work requirements, it is clear that this bill affects the 
life of every American in many, many important ways.
  I would like to highlight three of those: food security, rural 
broadband, and our Nation's drug supply.
  First, this bill makes sure that vulnerable Americans have proper 
nutrition. Members on both sides of the aisle have shown strong support 
for nutrition programs, including the women's, infants', and children's 
nutrition program called WIC and the Commodity Supplemental Food 
Program for the needy elderly. There are many other nutrition programs 
that receive strong support, as well.
  Our committee and the entire Congress have worked well together to 
meet our current needs and to build upon these base programs to support 
those who have suffered the indignity of food insecurity, which is 
heightened right now during the midst of this pandemic.
  Second, our health not only depends upon good food, but it depends 
upon the integrity of our drug supply.
  During the pandemic, America learned what we here already knew: We 
are importing drugs and drug ingredients from countries that do not 
necessarily share our commitment to transparency, quality, or the 
protection of labor.
  Approximately 80 percent of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are 
sourced from outside of the United States. The bill directs the FDA to 
block entry of products from those drug manufacturing plants overseas 
that prevent immediate inspection just like we have in America. 
Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I would be more comfortable if I saw the ``Made 
in America'' label on each prescription bottle.
  Third, telehealth, tele-education, and telework are here to stay and 
are revolutionizing the way we think about and structure community. But 
here is our problem: Too many parts of the country don't have access to 
high-speed internet, about 35 percent of rural areas and, as has been 
noted, some urban areas as well.
  A mother from Columbus, Nebraska--a community that is rural in 
character of about 25,000 people--recently told us that she had to 
drive to the local public school parking lot in order to access their 
broadband and their WiFi to help her child do homework. I think we can 
do better than this, Mr. Speaker.
  This bill does provide over $1 billion of funding for the expansion 
of rural broadband and new metrics to measure

[[Page H3795]]

its success. Because it is not just about service providers or wires 
laid; it is about functionality and the mission of what I call creating 
an ecosystem of livability.
  The ideas behind what is traditionally called rural development 
really do need to change. The farm of the future concept will be driven 
by data-driven solutions, precision agriculture, and resilient ag 
practices that increase productivity, generate value-added products, 
enhance sustainability in ag communities, and put an important emphasis 
on local foods in addition to the expansion of the opportunities for 
telehealth, telework, and tele-education.

                              {time}  1500

  I want to also note something that Chairman Bishop has done. He has 
placed an important emphasis on expanding resources to historically 
Black colleges and universities, an area where we can all look for 
enhanced opportunity.
  Let me note the current challenges at the source of a disagreement in 
the bill.
  One of the objections relates to the budget used by the majority to 
fund these 12 bills in violation of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.
  Another objection is less about numbers and more about our commitment 
to one another. The problem is that the bill permanently disallows any 
future changes on work requirements in the SNAP program. From my 
perspective, when times are good and the economy is strong, the program 
should be allowed to adjust accordingly as persons seek meaningful 
work.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing our work together to 
improve this bill and, once we do so, to potentially pass it into law.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), chairwoman of the 
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related 
Agencies.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New 
York, Chairwoman Lowey, for yielding and for all of her hard work and 
leadership during this process and for her distinguished years of 
service. I am sad this is the last time that we will do this together, 
but I am so appreciative of her leadership and mentorship of me 
personally. I will truly, truly miss her.
  Mr. Speaker, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related 
Agencies division of the bill highlights our continued commitment to 
our servicemembers and their families and to our veterans.
  Constructing the barracks, bases, and facilities that our military 
needs is crucial to our country's military readiness. Properly funding 
the Department of Veterans Affairs is how we deliver on the promise of 
medical care and other benefits that our veterans have earned through 
service to our Nation.
  The related agencies, including the American Battle Monuments 
Commission and Arlington National Cemetery, demonstrate to the world 
how we honor the sacrifices of those who served. That is why I am proud 
this bill includes $115.5 billion in discretionary funding, which is a 
$5.1 billion increase above the enacted fiscal year 2020 funding level 
and $2.3 billion above the President's budget request.
  For Military Construction, we provided $10.1 billion, rejecting the 
President's proposed cut of $3.6 billion below the current level for 
critical infrastructure needs on military installations. This includes 
$439.5 million for the Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment 
Program, which is $297 million above the request, and $1.49 billion for 
family housing construction, which is $135 million above the request, 
as well. We added these resources in order to fund critical oversight 
to address unacceptable conditions in military family housing, like 
mold, vermin, and lead.
  Mr. Speaker, $200 million is provided to clean up PFOS and PFOA 
contamination at previously closed installations.
  The bill also includes a new provision to prohibit military 
construction projects on installations named for Confederate officers 
until a process is initiated to rename those bases. No servicemember 
should live or train on a base named for a person who betrayed 
America's pursuit of a more perfect Union.
  For the VA, this bill provides a total of $240.2 billion, including 
mandatory spending; $104.8 billion is discretionary funding. This 
amount represents an increase of $12.3 billion above the fiscal year 
2020 enacted level.
  The $90 billion within this total for VA medical care fully funds the 
budget request.
  I am proud that this bill will improve the quality of veterans' 
healthcare through significant investments in women's veterans' health, 
the ``whole health'' model, mental health and suicide prevention, 
homelessness assistance, rural health, and opioid abuse prevention.
  We also finally achieved consensus with the Senate that the cost of 
VA healthcare cannot remain within the budget caps. So $12.5 billion 
within the overall total of $104.8 billion for VA programs is 
designated as emergency funding to adequately fund VA healthcare for 
its more than 7.2 million patients.
  The bill boosts funding for VA research by 5 percent over the fiscal 
year 2020 enacted level to support the important work studying rare 
cancers and prosthetics for women veterans, just to name a few.
  It also provides funding for infrastructure improvements to ensure 
the VA has modern, safe facilities to treat our veterans, as well as 
supports continued implementation of the Electronic Health Record 
Modernization implementation and efforts to reduce the disability 
claims backlog.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of what this bill does, but I am equally 
proud of what it does not do.
  It does not fund the border wall, nor does it allow the President to 
bypass congressional intent and divert vital military construction 
funding from previously approved national security projects in support 
of an ineffective, unnecessary barrier. We cannot allow Presidential 
bigotry and xenophobia to be prioritized over American lives, our 
servicemembers, or our national security.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member, subcommittee partner, Judge 
Carter, and Ranking Member Granger. We worked very well together. And 
while we may not always agree on these issues, we are agreeable, and I 
am proud to have them as partners and friends and truly appreciate 
their insights.
  I also thank the staff of both the subcommittee and in our personal 
offices, whose expertise and commitment to our servicemembers and our 
veterans is evident every day.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, it is a strong bill, and, most 
importantly, it does right by our servicemembers, their families, and 
our veterans.

  I also would briefly discuss a few of our accomplishments in the 
other divisions of this minibus.
  The Agriculture division supports our Nation's farmers, strongly 
invests in lifesaving nutrition programs, like WIC and SNAP, and blocks 
Trump's cruel SNAP regulations.
  The bill also includes funding and language to strengthen the 
regulation of e-cigarettes to break the epidemic of nicotine addiction 
that is gripping our Nation's youth.
  The Interior division protects our invaluable public lands, invests 
in climate resilience, and helps us restore our crumbling 
infrastructure, like the sewage failures in Fort Lauderdale. And I am 
particularly pleased that the bill includes language I requested that 
would block offshore drilling in any new area, including Florida's 
coastlines.
  Finally, the State and Foreign Operations division empowers women by 
increasing funding for international family planning and health 
programs. The bill expands aid for those struggling within Venezuela 
and for the refugees fleeing the economic collapse and oppression of 
the Maduro regime, and it ensures our ally, Israel, can defend herself, 
which is critical to our national security.
  Mr. Speaker, I personally thank our incredible staff: Lisa Molyneux, 
our clerk; Jennifer Hollrah; Sarah Young; Nicole Cohen; Keihysha 
Cenord; Lauren Wolman, on my personal staff; Michael Harris on my 
personal staff; and, of course, Shalanda Young, our intrepid clerk of 
our full committee, and the entire front office staff as well.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this spending package, 
and I thank everyone for their hard work.

[[Page H3796]]

  

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. Joyce), the ranking member of Subcommittee on Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies.
  Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7608.
  Before I get into the details of division C, the Interior and 
Environment section of the bill, I take a moment to thank Chairwoman 
Lowey and Ranking Member Granger for their steadfast leadership on the 
Committee on Appropriations.
  I extend my thanks to my friend and colleague, Betty McCollum, the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, Related Agencies. 
Chair McCollum has been an excellent leader, and I am glad to have the 
opportunity to serve alongside her as the ranking member on the 
subcommittee.
  Mr. Speaker, the fiscal year 2021 Interior, Environment bill includes 
many bipartisan initiatives to conserve and protect our natural 
resources and to increase the Federal commitment to honor our treaties 
and trust responsibilities with American Indians and Alaska Natives.
  The bill increases investments in wildfire suppression, hazardous 
fuels activities, provides additional support for the National Park 
Service, EPA's rural water technical assistance grants, and fully funds 
the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program.
  The bill also provides significant funding--more than one-quarter of 
the bill--to help Tribal communities across Indian Country with 
healthcare, education, and law enforcement needs. This support is 
essential given, on a per capita basis, COVID-19 has hit Indian Country 
harder than any other area in our Nation.
  As a co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I 
was pleased to see critical funding included to implement the Violence 
Against Woman Act in Indian Country and to support Operation Lady 
Justice, an initiative established by the President to address missing 
and murdered indigenous people, human trafficking, and other violent 
crimes.
  Chair McCollum and her staff have worked hard to accommodate these 
requests for Members on both sides of the aisle in the bill. They will 
be appreciated by our constituents, regardless of party.
  In particular, I am grateful for the continued, robust investment in 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is essential to reducing 
harmful algal blooms, eradicating Asian carp, and addressing coastline 
erosion.
  However, despite these investments and bipartisan priorities, there 
are concerns in this bill that will need to be addressed before we 
reach bipartisan agreement.
  First and foremost, the bill adds several new controversial policy 
riders, administrative provisions, and report language directives. 
These partisan provisions prevent the administration from reducing 
regulatory burdens and limit responsible natural resource development.
  Limiting our domestic supply of much-needed natural resources does 
not decrease our demand for them, it only makes us more dependent on 
foreign nations to obtain them, which is not only a national security 
concern, but is also an economic security concern. We cannot protect 
American jobs if we cannot supply them with the energy and raw 
materials.
  This bill also eliminates several longstanding commonsense provisions 
that have enjoyed bipartisan support for many years. Adding these 
provisions back will be essential to reaching a bipartisan agreement.
  A final area of concern is the funding level proposed in this bill. 
This bill benefits from off-budget emergency funding provided in other 
bills, and instead of using the savings from the passage of the Great 
American Outdoors Act towards paying down our ever-growing national 
debt, the bill reallocates those funds.
  The bill also includes a new title, with $15 billion in so-called 
emergency spending for additional infrastructure.
  To be clear, there are critical infrastructure programs in this bill 
that need these funds and more, but that alone does not give the 
Federal Government license to continue to borrow and spend without any 
overarching plan for fiscal responsibility.

  Mr. Speaker, it is for a combination of these funding and policy 
reasons that I cannot support this bill at this time and in its current 
form, but I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle as we move through the fiscal year 2021 process to craft a 
bill that can receive bipartisan support.
  Mr. Speaker, until then, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' 
on this package.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member, Ms. Granger, and Chair Lowey. Also, I give thanks to Chair 
McCollum and also Ranking Member Joyce on the Appropriations 
Subcommittee for Interior for allowing the provision that I am going to 
speak about to be included in today's legislation.
  It is very important because this inclusion was language from a bill 
that I introduced, the Springfield Race Riot National Historic Monument 
Act, and that is in the fiscal year 2021 Interior Appropriations bill.
  Mr. Speaker, my bill would designate the 1908 Springfield Race Riots, 
which ultimately played an integral role in the formation of the NAACP, 
it would designate the site of those race riots.
  For over the last few years, because of a Federal project, we have 
been uncovering artifacts from those race riots. We want to tell a 
story about those race riots and why America and Springfield, Illinois, 
should never have anything like that happen again. This language would 
authorize the Park Service to conduct a special resource study to 
determine its eligibility into the park system.
  Thank you, again, to all who have made this a possibility. Building 
off conversations that we had on the floor yesterday, I am grateful for 
this opportunity to further engage in the important discussions that we 
are having surrounding race in this country.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to supporting a final package that 
includes this language to give this site and the events that occurred 
there proper recognition.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).
  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, in times like this, it is 
easy to understand why we have a social safety net.
  Today, 6 million more Americans are on food stamps than were in 
February. Now, SNAP encourages work and education. Those are the 
critical ingredients in upward mobility. And by design, those 
requirements are flexible enough to account for difficult economic 
times.
  Despite that flexibility, the majority is using this appropriations 
process to prohibit future administrations from more effectively 
encouraging work and education.
  Now, yes, we are in difficult economic times, but as our economy 
recovers, work and education will be even more important. By setting 
aside that emphasis, we are not improving our country. We are not 
reducing dependence. We are not improving economic opportunity.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to reconsider.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, this package of appropriations bills will 
help make our Nations stronger at home and respected again in the 
world.
  Together, we can bolster food security, combat climate change, 
protect our environment, aid the world's most vulnerable people, and 
meet our commitments to our veterans.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this important legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAPTUR. I applaud Chairwoman Lowey in her resolve to accomplish 
Congress' top Constitutional priority assuring the operation of the 
government of the United States and in record speed this year, despite 
a global pandemic. Today's bold Appropriation minibus, which includes 
State and Foreign Operations, Agriculture and Rural Development, 
Interior

[[Page H3797]]

and Environment, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, 
reflects historic investments to meet the needs of the American people 
and strengthen our national resolve during an unprecedented period in 
American history.
  Here are a handful of provisions that make this bill strong.
  The bill prioritizes U.S. national security interests, including at 
liberty's edge in Central and Eastern Europe. It takes valuable steps 
to combat Russian aggression, it demonstrates our unwavering support 
for liberty in Ukraine, funds diplomatic exchanges between the U.S. and 
Poland, and protects Radio Free Europe's longstanding editorial 
independence.
  Then with acute food insecurity exposed in the pandemic, this bill 
advances sustainable agriculture in this era of climate change. It 
provides much needed support to hungry Americans, while giving rebirth 
to an idea cultivated by the Greatest Generation, Victory Gardens so 
every American family can reconnect with the power of earth to sustain 
life.
  As a lifelong resident of Toledo, Ohio, the distress from which our 
beloved Lake Erie and all our Great Lakes have struggled as a result of 
harmful algal blooms and invasive species like Grass Carp is a daily 
concern. For the last decade, we've lived with putrid green algae 
floating atop Lake Erie's Western Basin and tributaries, causing 
environmental, economic, and public health crises in the process. 
That's why I've fought to increase federal funding for projects like 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which will receive $335 million 
in this bill and other fresh water sources.
  This bill says thank you to America's veterans, from general 
healthcare and mental health services, to suicide prevention and 
homeless assistance. This legislation makes historic investments to 
improve the delivery of care, with extra focus on women veterans. It 
also, underscores the importance of the VA's workforce and makes 
recruitment and retention a top priority.
  These examples are but a few of the worthy causes included in this 
effort that make America even greater.
  Mr. Speaker, this legislative package demonstrates the good a unified 
Congress can achieve when we work together, even during a pandemic 
where much of our work has been carried out remotely. I would like to 
thank Chairwoman Lowey for her remarkable leadership throughout this 
process, as well as each of the subcommittee chairs for their dutiful 
work getting this legislation across the finish line. I urge strong 
bipartisan support.
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey, Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on provisions 
of H.R. 7608.
  Someday, future generations of Americans will look back on us and 
wonder how and why a society that prided itself on its commitment to 
human rights, precluded virtually all protection to the weakest and 
most vulnerable--unborn children.
  I believe they will demand to know why dismembering a child with 
razor-sharp knives, pulverizing an infant with powerful suction 
devices, or chemically poisoning a baby with any number of toxic 
``medications'', failed to elicit empathy for victim-babies.
  The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, reverses several modest but 
important pro-life polices including the Protecting Life in Global 
Health Assistance Policy--which is a reiteration and expansion of 
President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy.
  Announced by Reagan at the United Nations Conference on Population 
Control in Mexico City in 1984--hence its name--the policy was and is 
designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer money is not funneled to foreign 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that perform or promote abortion 
as a method of family planning.
  I would note parenthetically, that over the years, I've sponsored 
many amendments on this floor to protect the Mexico City Policy, 
beginning in 1985.
  The policy restored by President Trump, now called the Protecting 
Life in Global Health Assistance Policy, established pro-child 
safeguards--benign, humane conditions--on about $8.8 billion in annual 
global health assistance.
  For years--under Presidents Clinton and Obama--foreign non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) had been empowered by U.S. taxpayer 
grant money--to weaken, undermine, or reverse prolife laws in other 
nations and to destroy the precious lives of unborn children.
  Many countries throughout the world have been besieged by aggressive 
and well-funded campaigns to overturn their pro-life laws and policies.
  The Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy mitigates U.S. 
taxpayer complicity in global abortion.
  U.S. foreign policy--and the foreign entities we fund with billions 
of dollars in grant money--should consistently affirm, care for, and 
tangibly assist women and children--including unborn baby girls and 
boys.
  Mr. Speaker, I am the prime author of several humanitarian and human 
rights laws including the historic Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 
the $30 billion five year reauthorization of the President's Emergency 
Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), End Neglected Tropical Diseases, the 
Autism CARES Act, the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, 
the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act, and much more.
  I am the prime author of the Microenterprise Results and 
Accountability Act and a second microenterprise law to help the poor, 
especially women, escape poverty through microenterprise grants, credit 
assistance, business development training--and self-sufficiency.
  I believe we must increase access to maternal and prenatal care and 
ensure access to safe blood and better nutrition for all women-
especially those living in poverty.
  We must also expand essential obstetrical services, including skilled 
birth attendants, while improving transportation to emergency care 
facilities to significantly reduce maternal mortality and morbidity--
including from obstetric fistula.
  I wrote a bill--the Foreign Relations Act of 2006-7--that passed the 
House. I included a life-saving provision to establish 12 fistula 
centers mostly in Africa.
  When the Senate failed to act on my comprehensive bill, I asked 
USAID's Kent Hill to initiate a fistula repair program by 
administrative action. He did. Approximately fifty-four thousand women 
have had a life-changing fistula surgical repair.
  Mr. Speaker, prioritizing programs that ensure adequate nutrition and 
supplementation for moms and children during the all-important first 
1,000 days of life--from conception to the second birthday--are among 
the most transformative, life-enhancing commitments that can be made.
  I've chaired several hearings on the stunning impact of the first 
1000 days and included the initiative in my bill that passed the 
House--the Global Food Security Act.
  Expanding all these initiatives make women and children healthier, 
stronger, and more resilient to disease and disability while reducing 
death and injury.
  No one is expendable or a throwaway.
  Mr. Speaker, birth is merely an event--albeit an important one--in 
the life of a child.
  Victim-babies and their mothers absolutely deserve respect, 
protection, and an abundance of compassion.
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7608, and I 
commend and thank the chairman and chairwomen who worked very hard to 
produce funding bills that reflect our ``For the People'' vision for 
America.
  This mini-bus composed of the State and Foreign Operations, the 
Agriculture, Interior and the Military Construction and Veterans 
Affairs appropriations bills provides critical resources for a wide 
range of our important domestic and international priorities.
  While there is much to be thankful for in this mini-bus, I would like 
to highlight a few of the many critical protections I requested for 
vulnerable animals which these subcommittee chairs graciously included 
in their bills.
  This bill defunds dog testing at the Veterans Administration and 
prohibits notorious Class B dealers from selling illegally acquired 
pets into research. It also provides emergency shelter options for 
domestic violence survivors with companion animals.
  It prevents horses from being slaughtered in America for human 
consumption and cracks down on the painful practice of horse soring.
  It pushes FDA to reduce primate testing and to retiree these animals 
to sanctuary.
  Finally, the mini-bus combats wildlife poaching and trafficking 
around the world and provides recovery funding for endangered species 
like the California Condor.
  Madam Speaker, Mahatma Gandhi once said the greatness of a nation can 
be judged by the way its animals are treated. I thank Chairman Bishop 
and Chairwomen Lowey, McCollum and Wasserman Schultz for demonstrating 
what that greatness looks like.
  I urge my colleagues to support animal welfare and our many ``For the 
People'' priorities and vote YES on H.R. 7608.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the amendment to H.R. 7608 proposed by my colleagues, Mr. Perry and Mr. 
Joyce from Pennsylvania. The amendment would prohibit the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) from fulfilling the role outlined in an 
agreement that the Agency entered into--along with six states and the 
District of Columbia--to restore the Chesapeake Bay. Like the rest of 
the Bay's 64,000 square mile watershed, in my district in Hampton 
Roads, Virginia, healthy tributaries and a healthy Chesapeake are vital 
to the environment, the economy, recreation, wildlife and our way of 
life.
  Despite the vital importance of the Bay, how to best address its 
deterioration was a concern for almost half a century. Prior to the 
states' agreement with the EPA, their individual efforts were largely 
unsuccessful. In 2010, however, the Environmental Protection Agency 
established Total Maximum Daily Load, limits on nutrient and sediment 
pollution

[[Page H3798]]

to improve the Bay's water quality. Though the work continues, this new 
level of coordination and federal-state cooperation has been very 
successful. Beyond the Chesapeake region, this level of coordination 
provides a unique precedent for other restoration efforts across the 
country. Unfortunately, this amendment would prohibit the EPA from 
fulfilling their crucial role, one that the watershed states have 
agreed is necessary. History makes it clear that the collaboration and 
partnership of state, local, Federal, and non-governmental partners 
will be required to restore this national treasure. I urge my 
colleagues to vote no on this amendment.
  I also rise in support of the amendment that my colleague Ms. Speier 
has introduced. I share the gentlewoman's concern about forcing non-
federal entities that have faithfully worked with the EPA to secure 
funding for the very successful Water Infrastructure Finance and 
Innovation Act (WIFIA) Program to reapply. In my district in Hampton 
Roads, the SWIFT project--or the Sustainable Water Initiative for 
Tomorrow--is currently very close to closing a loan to move forward 
with their work to replenish the Potomac aquifer. Changing the 
application process for non-federal applicants that are already so far 
along in the process is wasteful and would unnecessarily delay projects 
that support access to safe and affordable water for our communities.
  In the case of the innovative SWIFT project, the WIFIA program 
supports my community's access to clean drinking water not only now, 
but also in the future as it recharges an aquifer on which most of 
eastern Virginia depends for their drinking water. In addition to 
limiting the amount of treated water that would otherwise be discharged 
into the James, Elizabeth, or York Rivers, this project would also 
yield enormous benefits to the entire region by slowing land 
subsidence, which is compounded in the Hampton Roads region by sea-
level rise. Importantly for agricultural producers, the project also 
promises to slow the intrusion of saltwater into groundwater in the 
region.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the WIFIA program and 
the many benefits that it provides.

                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Allen

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No.

  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division A (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. ___.  Each amount made available by this Act (other 
     than an amount required to be made available by a provision 
     of law) is hereby reduced by 5 percent.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, once again this Congress is being asked to vote on an 
enormous spending package after being produced in just the last few 
weeks.
  How can the American people possibly have time to learn where their 
tax dollars are going?
  Today, we are considering amendments to a four-bill, 689-page package 
that totals $219.6 billion in discretionary spending, plus another 
$37.5 billion in emergency spending.
  The bills in this package spend billions on top of what the current 
budget agreement allows, and they also contain partisan poison pills, 
like overturning the administration's Mexico City Policy, allowing 
foreign organizations to receive Federal funds, even if they perform 
abortions.
  Let me underscore, under the Democrat majority, we can't even stick 
to the budget that was agreed to.
  As a former business owner--and if you talk to any business owner, 
they will tell you the same thing--you have to operate within a budget.
  Every day, families across this country are sitting down at the 
kitchen table making tough choices to live within their means.
  I am appalled by the lack of fiscal responsibility being shown by 
this body today as we seem to hold ourselves to a different standard 
than American workers and families.
  Unfortunately, that is just business as usual in the 116th Congress.
  The level of appropriations for State Department and Foreign 
Operations, which is what this amendment is specifically targeting, is 
$8.5 billion higher than Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of nearly 15 
percent.
  The bill continues funding normal activities through Overseas 
Contingency Operations, rather than through the normal funding 
accounts, which is a mechanism that was originally set up to avoid 
spending constraints.
  My amendment today is simple. It would reduce State and Foreign 
Operations spending by 5 percent for Fiscal Year 2021. If you do the 
math, my amendment would cut about $3.3 billion.
  Even with my modest 5 percent cut, this division would still increase 
spending for Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020.
  I believe my Democratic colleagues should support my amendment, since 
they will still be spending a lot of your hard-earned money, just a bit 
less than they initially intended.
  I want to be clear, though. I do not want to cut funding going 
towards our cherished and critical ally, Israel.
  I also want to know that our diplomatic efforts abroad are necessary. 
In fact, my son is currently living overseas and working on behalf of 
our Nation's interests. But it is important that we look at the balance 
sheet and make cuts wherever possible.
  We can no longer neglect our national debt crisis, and my colleagues 
must take a serious look at Washington spending and start to take back 
control.
  For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must act 
immediately to rein in Federal spending so we don't leave our next 
generation with an insurmountable debt.
  Mr. Speaker, I am the proud grandfather of 13 grandchildren, with one 
on the way, and I believe it is my duty to do everything in my power to 
avoid placing a $26 trillion and rising burden of debt on their backs.
  My amendment is just a small first step toward bringing fiscal 
responsibility back to Washington. I urge all my colleagues in this 
body to support my amendment today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the 
gentleman's amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, our committee has worked hard on a bipartisan basis to 
craft a bill that provides the necessary tools to the Secretary of 
State and the USAID administrator to advance United States foreign 
policy.
  Mr. Speaker, I have long opposed amendments that indiscriminately 
apply across-the-board cuts to the carefully considered funding in this 
bill, which addressed many of the requests brought to the committee 
from both Democrats and Republicans in the House.
  Such amendments make no provision for protecting high-priority 
programs and activities. For example, this amendment would cut $165 
million

[[Page H3799]]

from security assistance for Israel. It would cut $457 million from 
global health programs, including $296 million less for HIV/AIDS 
activity. This amendment would cut $391 million from lifesaving 
humanitarian assistance and $305 million from funds made available to 
protect our diplomats and development personnel and the facilities in 
which they work and live overseas.
  In addition to assistance for our ally Israel, cuts would also impact 
funding for other key allies, such as Jordan, Egypt, Ukraine, Colombia, 
and countries in Eastern Europe that are battling Russian aggression 
and disinformation.
  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I understand we are in unprecedented times. But of the 
$10 billion in spending that Democrats say go towards international 
coronavirus relief, only $2.5 billion is designated to health programs, 
and a significant amount of those funds are diverted away from 
coronavirus.
  And let me just say that I understand the need to work with our 
allies on a vaccine and global health response to the coronavirus, but 
I believe that our priorities should be focused on combatting the virus 
here in the United States.

  Mr. Speaker, I cannot overstate the importance of restoring fiscal 
sanity here in the United States Congress. It is in the best interests 
of the future of our country that we take desperately needed steps to 
rein in our national debt.
  We are passing along to future generations an enormous debt burden. 
Does anybody understand that? I mean, can you imagine our children's 
children's children's children dealing with this?
  I would ask all my colleagues today to think about your kids, your 
grandkids, and your great-grandkids before casting your vote.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the distinguished ranking member on the State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
gentleman's amendment. This bill funds a number of important programs 
that are part of our national security. While I believe there is room 
for a small reduction, taking cuts across the board is not an 
appropriate way to carry that out.
  The amendment would cut everything across the bill, indiscriminately, 
and that includes the $3.3 billion, as has been mentioned, in foreign 
military financing for Israel. Reducing funding for Israel's security 
by $165 million, in addition to reductions to embassy security and 
other key investments, is ill-advised. There is a better way.
  I urge Members to oppose the amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, our national security is strongest when development, 
diplomacy, and defense are equally prioritized. This amendment 
undermines U.S. leadership and diminishes our engagement in the world.
  Yes, I do think of my eight grandchildren when I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. Allen).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it.
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

     following: ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by 
     $1,000,000)''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) and the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. Granger) will each control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. Craig).
  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, we owe our veterans our utmost respect and a 
debt that can never be repaid.
  Earlier this year, I testified for increased mental health services, 
especially in rural communities, and increased access to care on behalf 
of the veterans in Minnesota's Second Congressional District.
  I am proud that my legislation is included in the bill that we will 
pass tomorrow, and it includes the following:
  My amendment for a $1.5 million increase in the Veterans Health 
Administration medical services' account to expand the Rural Health 
Resources Center's program and increase funding for the Office of Rural 
Health so that they can continue their research to navigate barriers 
and expand access to care.
  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in stepping up to support our 
veterans.

                              {time}  1530

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. Stewart).
  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to amendment No. 
69, sponsored by Representative Cohen from Tennessee, which is included 
in this en bloc.
  While I appreciate the gentleman's concerns for our Nation's wild 
horse and burros, and I don't doubt that at all, the amendment is 
misguided and will actually end up hurting these animals more than it 
helps.
  I have been working on this issue for more than 6 years. There is 
nothing more important to the rural part of my district than is this, 
yet none of the sponsors of this amendment came to me to talk about 
this amendment. If they had come, I could have saved them some time.
  The amendment seeks to push the PZP contraceptive. The only problem 
with that is it doesn't work. Instead, we should allow research 
scientists and the BLM to do their jobs in determining the best way to 
manage these herds.
  Tying their hands by earmarking 50 percent of the increase on PZP 
birth control doesn't allow them to follow the best science to maintain 
healthy herds and healthy ranges. If you care about these animals and 
if you don't want to see them starve to death, then, please, work with 
us, and let's defeat this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude, if I have a few more seconds. We 
have a diverse and bipartisan group that has been working on this, as I 
have, for many years.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), the co-chair of the DPCC.
  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan en 
bloc amendment and three of my important amendments included in this 
package to address PFAS contamination.
  PFAS is a national health and environmental crisis. It is growing in 
scope every day, contaminating our air, water, and soil. Michigan has 
been hit hard. But yesterday, we led in setting the standard in the 
absence of Federal action.
  My main amendment will ensure that the administration cannot withdraw 
their decision issued in January to proceed with the national drinking 
water standard for PFO and PFOS. It will also prevent the 
administration from reversing its efforts to designate these notorious 
chemicals as hazardous substances under the Superfund program, which 
will kick-start the cleanup process at the most contaminated sites 
nationwide.
  This amendment doesn't go far enough, but it is a beginning to make 
sure we don't go backward in our efforts. I push all of my colleagues 
to join these efforts as cosponsors and thank Chair McCollum for her 
enduring leadership in this year's Interior appropriations bill.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
support this bloc of bipartisan amendments, which contains two 
amendments I have offered with my friends across the aisle.
  Mr. Soto and I introduced an amendment which will support important 
fertilizer research and development through the fertilizer management 
initiative, as this body authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill.
  I also would like to speak on an amendment I offered with Mr. 
Panetta, which will empower agriculture employees to provide personal 
protective equipment for our essential agriculture workers. This 
pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives, but what has not 
changed is the critical role that our farmers, our ranchers, and our 
agricultural employees play in putting food on our tables and securing 
our Nation's food supply.
  It is my hope that this amendment will lead to a larger conversation 
about how we ensure the safety of those working hard to feed our 
country and strengthen our agricultural industry.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments, and I 
look forward to continuing our bipartisan work.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Ms. Titus).
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, for more than 80 years, Hagia Sophia has 
served as a museum visited by people from all

[[Page H3802]]

around the globe. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is an 
architectural masterpiece, with a complex history as a place of worship 
for both Christians and Muslims.
  Changing its status is an affront to religious pluralism, and it 
jeopardizes its standing. This amendment encourages the State 
Department to denounce Turkey for taking this despicable action and to 
engage for the purpose of returning its status to a museum.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this amendment.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all veterans living rurally 
and remotely, I rise in support of my amendment included in this en 
bloc package.
  The amendment focuses additional efforts within the Veterans Health 
Administration Office of Rural Health on solutions that will bring more 
connectivity to veterans living in rural and remote areas.
  My district features not just rural but remote communities where many 
veterans are unable to access high-speed broadband. The coronavirus has 
only further highlighted this digital divide.
  The VA and Congress proactively responded to the pandemic with 
increased telehealth resources for veterans. This is a crucial and 
critical step, but what good is it for the veterans who don't have 
access to broadband in the first place?
  We need to keep our Nation's promises to all veterans, including 
those living in rural and remote communities.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 45 seconds to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 7608, which provides an additional $1 million for the VA to 
conduct educational outreach to veterans about the Airborne Hazards and 
Open Burn Pit Registry.
  My amendment will help veterans exposed to burn pits by strengthening 
the burn pit registry and making patients aware of early warning signs 
of life-threatening illnesses as well as the existence of the registry.
  My amendment will also fund additional research on the health effects 
of burn pits, using the data from the registry.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help our veterans exposed to 
burn pits by supporting my amendment.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House.
  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, Madam Chair, and Madam Ranking Member, this 
could be a good bill, but there are some provisions that shouldn't be 
in it that were put in it.
  One is ANWR, which we passed in this House 13 times with help from 
both sides, open an Arctic wildlife range. There is a provision here to 
prohibit that.
  There is also a provision not to repeal the roadless area in the 
Tongass National Forest.
  There is a provision about not allowing the State of Alaska to 
control the fishing and hunting rights of the State of Alaska on 
Federal lands, as it is now.
  You know, I resent it. To allow other Members of Congress to come 
into your district or my district and tell us how we should represent 
them, this is not the way to do business. This is the House of the 
people, as representatives of the people, duly-elected from each 
constituent.
  Everyone that I know of in my State opposes these riders and these 
amendments. But for some reason, there is a group that say, ``Oh, we 
know better than the people,'' the Congressmen. We know what is best 
for us, and it is not their district.
  The Tongass, for instance, is an area of 16 million acres of land. 
Prohibiting harvesting timber or access because of the roadless 
definition of the Obama administration is wrong. We have harvested less 
than 400 acres of that whole total 16 million acres of land. We are not 
asking to harvest that, but we want access for communities. And there 
are other parts of our State, lands within that forestland, but this 
provision, this rider, would preclude that. That is not representation 
from a Congress of the people.
  I have watched this body now in 48 years dissolve into what I call an 
adversarial position on both sides by label. That is not 
representation. These riders shouldn't be in here. These amendments 
should not be accepted if you believe in the House of Congress for the 
people of America. If you don't believe that, maybe we ought to set up 
a different system. These should not be in this bill.
  The bill, overall, is not a bad bill. I think it is pretty good. In 
fact, there are some good things in there for Alaska. But you had to 
let these little mice come into the barn and eat the grain and leave 
residue behind.
  I am making a suggestion. When you write these bills, be very careful 
what you allow to be put in the bills that don't apply to the bill and, 
in fact, are personal interests not only from those Congressmen that 
submitted them but wrong for the State of Alaska.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the two amendments that I have in the en bloc 
concern horses.
  One concerns wild horses and a more humane way to deal with the wild 
horse population. Right now, the Bureau of Land Management uses 
helicopters, rounds them up, and puts them in pens for the rest of 
their lives. This would be a more humane practice and cost only 10 
percent of their budget, and it would certainly be something the 
Rolling Stones would be for, ``Wild Horses.''
  The other is one that would give money for an audit on the soring 
practices of Tennessee walkers, an inhumane practice that has gone on 
for a long time. We need to be considerate of our four-legged friends, 
and this would support the walking horses.
  Mr. Speaker, I am thankful to see these included in the en bloc, and 
I am pleased to see this progress.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Barr).
  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to 
this appropriations package that highlights the need to use all the 
tools in America's tool kit to counter the Chinese Communist Party and 
the totalitarian government in Beijing.
  My amendment shows bipartisan support for the United States 
International Development Finance Corporation and its important work to 
counter China's Belt and Road Initiative.
  As a member of the House's China Task Force and former chair of the 
House Financial Service's Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade 
with jurisdiction over the Treasury Department's national security 
portfolio, I am keenly aware of the threat that China poses through its 
Belt and Road Initiative and direct foreign investment internationally.
  While we will never match China dollar for dollar in government 
subsidies, agencies like DFC can leverage the unlimited potential of 
the private sector to counter China's model of debt-trap diplomacy and 
colonialism.
  I am proud to support DFC in promoting private investment in 
developing countries, its role in advancing U.S. global development 
goals and economic interests, and offering an alternative to China's 
malign investment overseas.

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).
  Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to 
increase funding for the Airborne Hazard and Burn Pit Center of 
Excellence.
  Burn pits have been called the Agent Orange of our generation. Too 
many of our veterans have been exposed to harmful chemicals from burn 
pits, which we know lead to increased risk of lung and respiratory 
diseases. We have seen this firsthand in my district due to the 
illnesses related to working on the burn pits on the pile in an area of 
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We must do more.
  The center located in New Jersey is doing critical research into the 
long-term health effects from burn pits, research our veterans and 
healthcare providers need.

[[Page H3803]]

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this package.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Soto).
  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, this appropriations package continues to make 
important investments to restore and protect the environment of our 
beautiful State of Florida.
  We have language in there encouraging the National Park Service to 
consider the Kissimmee River at the headwaters of the Everglades for 
the Wild and Scenic Rivers Program, one of the highlights of our 
district.
  Everglades restoration: over $15 million, including $10 million for 
CERP.
  We help address harmful algal blooms that hurt our coast, including 
recognizing the threat and encouraging EPA for more support and 
research.
  We address the threats to the Great Florida Reef by recognizing the 
coral disease outbreak and recommending additional resources with State 
and local partners.
  We help out with sinkholes throughout Florida by having the USGS 
identify and map them out so we can protect Floridians.
  We are also recognizing natural disasters like the earthquake in 
Puerto Rico by continuing to develop new programs.

                              {time}  1545

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Panetta).
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  I rise today to offer an amendment to protect our Nation's 
farmworkers.
  This pandemic has shown that our farmworkers are absolutely 
essential. They show up to work every day to keep our communities fed 
and our Nation's food secure. But due to living and working conditions, 
many are uniquely susceptible to this disease.
  That is why we must dedicate immediate and robust funds to the USDA 
to establish an emergency program that covers the cost of PPE and other 
safety measures to protect our farmworkers.
  And that is just the beginning. We need to provide our farmworkers 
with proper pay, job security, methods for childcare, family leave, and 
support for their families.
  Our farmworkers deserve and require action from the Federal 
Government to protect our food supply and our food security.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).
  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for 
her tremendous leadership. I also thank Chairwoman McCollum and Ranking 
Member Joyce for working with me on this very important amendment.
  In my congressional district in North Carolina resides the Uwharrie 
National Forest, which many of my constituents call home. This national 
treasure is a pillar of our community and brings folks from all across 
the Nation and the world to North Carolina every year. But for those 
who live in the Uwharrie National Forest, it looks a lot different.
  My constituents in the Green Gap community have had to contend with 
dangerous roads in the Uwharrie National Forest for years while the 
Forest Service has neglected their maintenance. As someone who has seen 
firsthand how dangerous these roads are, I can attest to the critical 
need to pave these roads.
  One of my constituents had a heart attack, and the ambulance couldn't 
get down the road because of ruts and the washouts. Thankfully, the 
desperate but resourceful paramedics got out of the ambulance and 
sprinted down the road with a stretcher.
  Another one of my constituent's house burned to the ground because 
the road was so impassable, the fire truck couldn't get to the house to 
put out the blaze.
  Put yourself in the shoes of my constituents. Imagine living with 
this fear every day.
  Working with me, the State of North Carolina has stepped up with 
financial assistance and agreed to maintain these roads. I am asking 
this Congress to also step up to ensure my constituents are not 
forgotten and they have access to critical lifesaving services they 
deserve.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  I rise in support of this package, which contains four amendments I 
introduced.
  My first amendment supports the family-owned dairy farms, backbones 
of the rural economy in northwestern New Jersey, which are facing major 
challenges from the pandemic.
  Dairy farmers have suffered more than $5.7 billion in losses from the 
crisis, and my amendment calls for support for the dairy farmers.
  My second amendment provides more resources for the inspector general 
of the VA to investigate and ensure proper compliance of the State-run 
veterans homes, like the disaster-stricken State-run New Jersey 
veterans home in Paramus, where 81 residents and one staff member 
tragically died from the coronavirus outbreak. My amendment will make 
much stronger Federal oversight of these facilities possible, which we 
need to protect our veterans.
  My third boosts investment for medical care at non-VA facilities to 
continue our fight for greater access to healthcare for veterans in 
north Jersey.
  And my fourth would increase investment for the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum's outreach services.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an 
additional 15 seconds.
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, my fourth amendment would increase 
investment for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's outreach 
services so more Americans can learn about the history of the 
Holocaust, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hatred, bigotry, and 
intolerance.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc set of 
amendments.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of further research, 
production, and use of PZP-22, native PZP, GonaCon, and other 
reversible fertility control to help reduce our country's untenable 
wild horse populations. Urgent action is needed to protect the wild 
horses and prevent further population increase.
  I support and thank my colleague Representative Steve Cohen and those 
who joined him in the Appropriations amendment which calls for 
$11,000,000 for the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Wild Horse and 
Burro Program budget. This funding would be used to implement a humane 
fertility treatment such as PZP, which is a reversible fertility 
control. This specific funding is a necessary and immediate measure 
that addresses the bipartisan call for humanely managing the wild horse 
population.
  In my district, the University of Toledo has led the way on research 
and production of PZP-22 for wild horse fertility control. BLM recently 
confirmed that PZP remains a necessary tool to control the wild herds. 
Unfortunately, BLM is not utilizing PZP or fertility controls to its 
fullest potential and is leaving research capabilities unutilized. BLM 
has a duty to continue the research, production, and use of proven 
contraception such as PZP-22, while also pursuing other efforts toward 
their goal of a vaccine that can be administered quickly and cost 
effectively. The Cohen Amendment draws critical attention to these 
measures.
  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House 
and the Bureau of Land Management to find a humane and effective 
solution to reversible fertility control. Until then, we must persist 
with proven reversible fertility vaccines to quell the unsustainable 
wild horse population.
  I urge adoption of the Cohen Amendment.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party's aggression and 
malign conduct grows more severe each day. The CCP's malfeasance 
allowed the COVID-19 outbreak to become a global pandemic, causing 
untold economic destruction. They conduct militarized territorial 
aggression against most countries that border China. The CCP is 
pioneering a new form of colonialism, degrading the sovereignty of 
developing nations through debt and corruption, extracting resources 
and military outposts. They have orchestrated the largest transfer of 
wealth in human history

[[Page H3804]]

through state-directed economic espionage against the United States and 
other advanced economies. And the CCP is responsible for the gravest 
human rights atrocities occurring in the 21st century. The evidence is 
manifest that the malign influence of the CCP is the greatest United 
States foreign policy challenge of this generation. It affects every 
one of our states and districts, a fact that was underscored this week 
by the closure of China's Houston consulate in response to multiple 
instances of economic espionage. We must sustain U.S. resources to 
counter this threat, so I am grateful that my amendment has been 
included in a bipartisan en bloc package for H.R. 7608, the Fiscal Year 
2021 State, Foreign Operations, Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Interior, Environment, Military Construction, and Veterans Affairs 
Appropriations Act. My amendment will partially restore the prior 
fiscal year's funding levels for the Countering Chinese Influence Fund, 
helping to ensure that appropriate resources are available to address 
this generational challenge. I'm glad that the House will address our 
leading foreign policy priority on a bipartisan basis, and thank my 
colleagues for supporting this measure to sustain U.S. resources to 
counter the malign influence of the CCP.
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment, 
numbered 40 to Division B of H.R. 7608, to provide $750,000 for the 
National Institute of Food and Agriculture's Agricultural and Food 
Research Initiative to research innovative practices to increase carbon 
storage in agricultural land. My amendment identifies Enhanced Rock 
Weathering as a priority research area, with a focus especially on how 
this practice enhances carbon sequestration or may affect air quality 
and soil health. Additionally, my amendment requires that research also 
identify any impacts this practice would have on workers and consumers.
  As discussed by a new major research study from the University of 
Sheffield, published in Nature, adding rock dust to farmland could 
remove up to two billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year 
and help significantly reduce our global CO2 footprint. The technique 
of adding crushed volcanic rock dust to farmland--known as ``enhanced 
rock weathering''--has shown great potential to increase the soil's 
extraction of carbon dioxide from the environment.
  However, there are significant gaps in this research, including the 
side effects of this method on public health for both farmworkers and 
neighboring communities, and USDA is not currently engaged in studying 
this particular practice. Clearly more research is needed on this 
technology, and USDA is well-positioned to fund this work.
  I urge the adoption of this commonsense amendment to this en-bloc 
package.
  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment numbered 
71 to Division C of H.R. 7608 to increase base funding to $300,000 
within the National Park Service budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 for 
the New England National Scenic Trail (NET).
  The NET was designated by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 
2009 making it the newest of the nation's 11 national scenic trails. 
The NET is a 220-mile hiking trail winding through 40 communities in 
Connecticut and Massachusetts. Nearly 2 million people live within 10 
miles of the trail, and since the designation, excitement about the 
trail and activities to improve the trail have continued to increase. 
The NET is managed through a partnership between the National Park 
Service and two of New England's most established nonprofit trail and 
conservation organizations--the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), 
established in 1876, and the Connecticut Forest & Park Association 
(CFPA), established in 1895.
  Since designation, the NET has been flat-funded at an average level 
of $127,000 in Operation of the National Park System funding, despite a 
conservative recommendation in its original 2005 NPS Trail Feasibility 
Study of an annual operating budget of $271,000. An increase in base 
funding is needed to implement the federal portion of the Trail 
Management Blueprint for the NET and to support the work of two trail 
partner organizations, the AMC and the CFPA.
  Based on more than a decade of experience with NET trail operations 
and needs, a total annual appropriation of $300,000 in FY 2021 is 
recommended to fully fund this trail and to support the work of 
volunteers, regional partners, and youth trail crews as they execute 
improvements to trail infrastructure, trail protection and planning, 
and trail information and promotion.
  I urge adoption of this en-bloc package, and I want to thank Mr. 
Himes, Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Larson, Ms. Hayes, Mr. Neal, and Mr. McGovern 
for their kind support for this measure.
  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of my amendment to H.R. 7608, Division B--Agriculture, Rural 
Development Appropriations Act of 2021. My amendment, included in the 
bipartisan en bloc, will increase funding for the Crop Protection and 
Pest Management program by $1 million. In 2017, the Allium leafminer--
an invasive pest that threatens onion crops--was discovered in Orange 
County's black dirt region. Orange County produces half of New York 
State's onion crop, generates $25 million in annual sales, and employs 
hundreds of residents. So, my office got to work with Dr. Brian Nault 
of Cornell. By leveraging a grant from the Crop Protection and Pest 
Management program, Dr. Nault has been working to find effective and 
sustainable solutions for managing the Allium leafminer. But he needs 
more help. My amendment will add $1 million into the program helping to 
save Orange County's onion crop. I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.
  Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairwoman 
Lowey for the opportunity to bring this critical amendment to the 
floor. Her leadership of the Committee is matched only by her 
commitment to combat the nefarious rise of anti-Semitism around the 
world, and unfortunately here at home.
  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment to the FY2021 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill, to 
increase the Diplomatic Policy and Support account by $500,000 in order 
to double the amount allocated for the Office of the Special Envoy to 
Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism (SEAS), Elan Carr.
  Over the last year, we've seen an increase in anti-Semitic rhetoric 
and violence directed against Jewish communities in the United States 
as well as around the world. In my home city of New York, hate crimes 
spiked by 72 percent over the same period last year. We've also seen 
distressing cases of violence, like the terror attacks in Monsey during 
the celebration of Hanukkah and the assault against a synagogue in 
Halle, Germany. We've even seen anti-Semites target Jewish Members of 
Congress like me for daring to stand up to them. It is clear that need 
to be investing, now more than ever, to monitoring and combatting anti-
Semitism wherever it rears its head.
  The Office of the Special Envoy, and especially Special Envoy Carr, 
have done incredible work addressing this rise in global anti-Semitism. 
Yet the office currently has only three dedicated full-time staffers, 
including the Special Envoy himself, and a number of detailees. The 
critical work of the Special Envoy and his Assistant Envoys requires 
the staff and the commensurate budget with which to confront this 
challenge. By doubling the amount allocated for the office, the Special 
Envoy will be able to hire more staff, to include specialists and 
operations support, as well as increase their activities identifying 
anti-Semitism and sharing best practices with Jewish communities around 
the world.
  This amendment will provide a much-needed investment at a critical 
time for Jews around the world. I urge its inclusion in the House 
Appropriations package, and thank my colleagues for their support.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of 
Jackson Lee Amendments to H.R. 7608, the State, Foreign Operations, 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Interior, Environment, Military 
Construction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.''
  I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for making these 
Jackson Lee amendments in order for House consideration of H.R. 7608.
  These Jackson Lee Amendments are straightforward and make the bill 
even better. I believe they would command the support of a majority of 
the House and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of them.
  The amendments are to the following divisions:
  Division A--Department of State, Foreign Operations;
  Division B--Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration; and
  Division C--Department of the Interior, Environment.


          Division A--Department of State, Foreign Operations

  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 11 will designate $1,000,000 to combat the 
trafficking of endangered species.
  My amendment makes a good bill better by providing a $1 million focus 
to combat the transportation of the remains of endangered species, to 
confront the transport of the remains of killed endangered species.
  The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being lured off a 
protected preserve was an indication that we needed to do more to 
protect endangered species at risk of being killed.

[[Page H3805]]

  At that time, I introduced and sought the support of my colleagues as 
original cosponsors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endangered and 
Threatened Species Act of 2015.
  This bill sought to strengthen partner countries' capacity in 
countering wildlife trafficking and designating major wildlife 
countries for protection.
  The amendment offered is in the same spirit: to prohibit the taking 
and transportation of any endangered and threatened species as a trophy 
to the United States.
  Currently, the Endangered Species Act does not protect most wildlife 
animals killed. At this point, we can choose to make wise decisions 
that will sustain the global population, or we can ignore the warning 
signs.
  I believe this amendment is one that Members can support because it 
would bring greater awareness and protection to these beautiful and 
vital populations that are too often taken for granted, by allowing 
this amendment to address the senseless trafficking in trophy killings 
of all endangered and threatened species.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 12 provides funds to be allocate funds 
provided for Global Health Programs to the fight against the practice 
of Female Genital Mutilation.
  I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long 
while, even working with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York to 
introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this 
ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.
  Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures 
that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, 
or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.
  This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to 
other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as 
child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the 
human rights of women and girls.
  Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women 
alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger 
representing 44 million of those who have been cut.
  For example, consider that:
  Around the world, at least five girls are mutilated/ cut every hour.
  More than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk of FGM/C, 
annually.
  The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can 
include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during 
childbirth and death.
  Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C 
include the high concentration in specific regions associated with 
several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.
  According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the 
world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and 
Asia.
  Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S. 
bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of 
combatting FGM/C abroad.
  The United Nations adopted a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
for 2030 that includes a target to eliminate FGM/C and recognizing the 
abandonment of this harmful practice can be achieved because of a 
comprehensive movement that involves all public and private 
stakeholders in society.
  With these provisions in place and my amendment increasing the 
funding for foreign assistance we can ensure Female Genital Mutilation/
Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally recognized violation of the human 
rights of girls and women comes to an end.
  Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a report in 2016 
estimating that 513,000 women and girls in the United States were at 
risk or may have been subjected to FGM/C.
  The presence of FGM/C in the United States brings a sobering truth to 
light, that we still have much work to do here at home to stop our 
young women and girls from suffering at the hands of this archaic and 
utterly unnecessary practice.
  I am reminded of the story of Hadiatu Jalloh, a 7-year-old from 
Sierra Leone, who with her mother fled to Houston to seek a life saving 
operation to rectify complications from the practice of FGM/C from 
which she suffered for more than a year.
  Due to complications from the FGM procedure, little Hadiatu could not 
stop bleeding, she then underwent two additional nonmedical procedures 
to repair the damage she suffered.
  However, the bleeding continued and after the second procedure to 
stop the bleeding, Hadiatu could not properly urinate and suffered 
terrible pain.
  In her desperate quest for help, Hadiatu's mother Umu took her 
daughter across the border to Sierra Leone, but still could not find a 
doctor to treat Hadiatu.
  Dr. Hardwick-Smith a world-renowned board certified OBGYN--along with 
a team led by Houston pediatric urologist Dr. Eric Jones--solved 
Hadiatu's problem by removing scar tissue during the successful 
surgery.
  Stories such like this remind me of the importance of this work, and 
how can we cannot afford to ignore any instance of FGM/C.
  And that is why earlier we celebrated the International Day of Zero 
Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, a multinational effort to 
bring this practice to an end.
  That is why my amendment reprograms funding that will be used by the 
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for elimination of 
FGM/C.
  The Jackson Lee Amendment increases funding to expedite the complete 
and total elimination of FGM/C.
  I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment.


       Division B--Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
                             Administration

  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 45 clarifies that nothing in the bill 
restricts the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or any federal 
agency head from providing assistance and benefits to victims of 
trafficking as permitted by 22 U.S.C. 7105(b) of the Victims of 
Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 1464, Pub. 
Law 106-386).
  Perpetrators of crime know that they are more likely to evade 
detection and punishment when their victims refuse to assist or 
cooperate with law enforcement. That is why they make it a point to 
instill fear in their victims--for their own safety or that of family 
and loved ones.
  Human trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to 
obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act.
  Every year, millions of men, women, and children are trafficked 
worldwide--including right here in the United States.
  It can happen in any community and victims can be any age, race, 
gender, or nationality.
  Traffickers might use violence, manipulation, or false promises of 
well-paying jobs or romantic relationships to lure victims into 
trafficking situations.
  Language barriers, fear of their traffickers, and/ or fear of law 
enforcement frequently keep victims from seeking help, making human 
trafficking a hidden crime.
  They look for people who are susceptible for a variety of reasons, 
including psychological or emotional vulnerability, economic hardship, 
lack of a social safety net, natural disasters, or political 
instability.
  The trauma caused by the traffickers can be so great that many may 
not identify themselves as victims or ask for help, even in highly 
public settings.
  Recognizing key indicators of human trafficking and providing support 
to victims so that traffickers are prosecuted is the first step in 
ending this crime.
  Victims are often alone and without resources to survive outside of a 
trafficker's control.
  Access to food programs is essential to escaping this terrible 
existence.
  I introduced this Jackson Lee amendment to provide food assistance to 
victims of human trafficking no matter who they are or where they may 
have come from.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 46 increases funding by $2,000,000 for the 
USDA agency that provides grant research funding for ``1890s Land Grant 
Universities,'' which are 28 Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities.
  The USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) works to 
improve our nation's food production through agricultural research, 
economic analysis, extension, and higher education.
  The NIFA was created at the time of the industrial revolution to 
ensure that the nation would have enough working farms to provide a 
reliable supply of domestically produced food.
  One of the ways NIFA achieves its mission is by providing research 
grants to education institutions, which include 1890s institutions 
created by the Morrill Act of 1890.
  Today, land-grant colleges and universities can be found in 18 
states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The list 
includes:
  Alabama A&M University, Alcorn State University, Delaware State 
University, Florida A&M University, Fort Valley State University, 
Kentucky State University, Langston University, Lincoln University, 
North Carolina A&T State University, Prairie View A&M University in 
Texas, South Carolina State University, Southern University System, 
Tennessee State University, Tuskegee University, University of Arkansas 
Pine Bluff, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, University of the 
District of Columbia, University of the Virgin Islands, Virginia State 
University, West Virginia State University.
  HBCUs annually enroll 40 percent of all African American students in 
4-year colleges and universities.
  HBCUs are prominent among research institutions in fields such as: 
animal sciences, sustainable agriculture and agriculture economics, 
toxicology and waste management, conservation and environmental 
management, business and industrial development, biomedical

[[Page H3806]]

science, food and nutrition, plant and social sciences, international 
development.
  Research is essential to meeting the food needs of people not only in 
the United States but around the world.
  In the U.S. the demand for fresh fruits and vegetables as well as 
concerns for the distance food travels before, it reaches tables in 
urban areas has led to more research on how to improve urban farming.
  Another aspect of research is improving the shelf life of fresh 
fruits and vegetables to slow the process of spoilage, which has proven 
to be one of the problems experienced during COVID-19 due to some 
disruptions caused by food supply chain difficulties.
  Extending shelf life of fresh fruits, and vegetables would also 
reduce food waste and improve diets for people on limited incomes by 
making fresh items will be as economical as canned or frozen.
  HBCU agriculture research institutions are playing a role in bringing 
urban farming to communities of color.
  HCBU's agricultural research programs also assist people living in 
densely populated areas to learn ways to eliminate food deserts, 
increase public education regarding farming, develop a greater 
appreciation for our nation's farmers, and provide new avenues for 
careers for those graduating with agriculture degrees seeking to enter 
into cutting edge agricultural research.
  The funds provided by the Jackson Lee amendment would support 
research and education into means for helping urban and suburban 
communities maximize their green space by turning it into productive 
farming resources to support access to affordable foods.
  The funding can also help to develop new research efforts directed at 
reducing food insecurity during a Pandemic or other crises that impact 
the availability or affordability of food.
  I ask for your support for these Jackson Lee Amendments.
  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc Amendment No. 1 
which includes my amendments number 16 to the State and Foreign 
Operations division and number 123 to the Military Construction and 
Veterans Affairs division of the bill.
  The first of these would provide an additional $1.5 million for 
counterterrorisrn financing. Our nation is facing unprecedented 
international challenges including an out-of-control pandemic, a global 
economic slowdown due to the coronavirus, and stepped up efforts by 
authoritarian governments to undermine democratic institutions both 
here and around the world.
  Unfortunately, these new trials do not diminish the importance of 
other critical longstanding challenges we have been tackling, including 
the threat of extremist groups and their terrorist tactics. Indeed, 
some groups have been trying to take advantage of the coronavirus 
pandemic to bolster their agendas and attract more recruits.
  As Chairman of the Oversight National Security Subcommittee and Co-
Chair of the Task Force on Terrorism and Proliferation Financing, I 
have seen how money is a lifeline for these groups. Cutting off 
financing is key to thwarting their efforts, and the best way to do 
that is by working with our allies. This additional funding will allow 
us to work even more closely with even more nations to starve these 
extremists of the capital they need to disseminate their agenda and 
carry out terror attacks.
  My second amendment, number 123, would provide an additional $1.5 
million for veterans' suicide prevention through the PREVENTS 
initiative. We are still seeing a suicide rate among our veterans that 
is unacceptably and tragically high at one-and-a-half times that of 
civilians. with women veterans twice as likely to die by suicide as 
their civilian counterparts.
  I chaired a National Security Subcommittee hearing last May examining 
veteran and active-duty military suicides, as well as efforts by the 
Department of Defense ( DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) to combat this problem. The testimony highlighted the need for 
comprehensive solutions that span the DOD and the VA, with a focus on 
high quality healthcare, provider training and education, and access to 
services and resources.
  Both the DOD and VA have made significant efforts to provide more 
services and outreach to prevent suicides among our servicemembers and 
veterans, but there is always much more that can be done. This 
additional funding will support public-private partnerships designed to 
provide greater access to the vital help that can save the lives of our 
brave men and women after they leave the military.
  I would like to thank Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Lowey and 
Ranking member Granger for including these amendments in this en bloc.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) and the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. Granger) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), the co-chair of the DPCC.
  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the wonderful chair of the 
Appropriations Committee for yielding.
  I rise in support of en bloc 2, which includes an important amendment 
to block the Trump administration's latest attack on the National 
Environmental Policy Act.
  For 50 years, NEPA has both protected and fought for the environment 
and empowered local communities protecting them. In many cases, NEPA 
provides ordinary Americans the only opportunity to have a voice on 
major projects, including pipelines or extractive activity like oil and 
gas drilling that directly impacts their communities.
  The administration's new NEPA rule both limits the scope of 
environmental review and exempts entire categories of projects from 
review all together.
  Mr. Speaker, the administration's attack on NEPA prioritizes special 
interests and polluters ahead of the American people and our 
environmental heritage. I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc 
amendment and to block this assault on one of our Nation's bedrock 
environmental laws.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this group of 
partisan, antiresource development amendments offered by several House 
Democrats. These provisions offered on the Interior appropriations bill 
will hamstring our Nation's efforts to secure our energy independence.
  Many of these amendments seek to prohibit oil and gas development, 
and, Mr. Speaker, I have just got to say, it is really quite ironic to 
see my colleagues who just yesterday voted for sweeping legislation 
mandating $900 million a year from the oil and gas industry for 
conservation projects to now, just one day later, not even 24 hours 
later, offer amendments to restrict the very industry that those 
projects depend upon.
  This is hypocrisy, plain and simple. But it is exactly what I shared 
in a message with my constituents yesterday. Democrats are trying to 
have their cake and eat it too. From the Green New Deal to Mr. Biden's 
energy plan to these irresponsible amendments we have here before us, 
Democrats continue to put forward ideas that are not based in reality 
and will harm our Nation's energy security.
  Another partisan amendment seeks to block the recent finalized rule 
by the Council on Environmental Quality to modernize severely outdated 
and burdensome National Environmental Policy Act regulations, something 
that has not been done for 40 years.
  According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Unlock American 
Investment coalition, we are now seeing infrastructure project delays 
of up to 20 years across our country. This is unacceptable, and it 
prevents critical repairs and construction of roads, of bridges, of 
airports, railways, renewable energy projects, even water 
infrastructure projects in the West and many more things.
  At a time when American jobs and the economy are facing significant 
challenges, these provisions threaten our Nation's resiliency, our 
energy independence, and our ability to recover from this pandemic.
  Please, Mr. Speaker, vote ``no'' on these amendments.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and 
for her incredible leadership.
  I rise in support of this package, which contains two amendments I 
have introduced.
  My first amendment addresses the harmful algal blooms impacting many 
north Jersey lakes and harming our ecotourism, local businesses, and 
residents. We need the U.S. Geological Survey to report to Congress on 
ways to combat toxic HABs like those in Greenwood Lake and Lake 
Hopatcong.
  My second amendment prohibits any funds in the bill being used to 
promote the sale of vaping and dangerous e-cigarette products, which 
can harm our children. We must do everything we can to help save lives 
and protect families by combating the youth vaping epidemic.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this set of amendments.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).
  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member from Texas (Ms. 
Granger) for yielding.
  This amendment would increase, by 100,000, the funding to combat the 
prevalence of female genital mutilation, FGM, around the world.
  FGM represents a grave moral evil, irreparably compromising the 
health and well-being of every woman and girl subjected to it.
  The practice of FGM occurs in 30 countries, in particular, Egypt, 
Indonesia, and Ethiopia, and has been performed on more than 200 
million women and girls to date. Every year, 3 million more girls are 
placed at risk, with most of the victims below the age of 15.
  The long-term effects of FGM are wide ranging, including post-
traumatic stress disorder, depression, flashbacks, self-harm, and 
severe difficulties during labor.
  In February, an Egyptian doctor was arrested for performing FGM on a 
12-year-old girl, resulting in her death, at the instruction of the 
girl's parents. The doctor conducted the practice without any 
anesthesia and without having the appropriate surgeon qualifications.
  To be clear, this is not an isolated case.
  Egypt has banned the practice of FGM since 2008 and criminalized it 
in 2016. The fact that it still happens to an overwhelming number of 
young girls in that country, despite the strict legal measures, 
illustrates the massive scope of this problem and the immense work 
remaining for each of us
  The U.S. must be unequivocal in condemning this disgusting, horrific 
practice and lead the world in calling for it to end, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Foster.)

[[Page H3816]]

  

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  My amendment directs the State Department to use $10 million from the 
NADR account to fund a major science facility in Jordan called SESAME, 
or the Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Application in 
the Middle East. SESAME is a cooperative venture by scientists and 
governments throughout the region, including Israel, Iran, and everyone 
in between.
  Science is a universal language that can cross barriers, and SESAME 
has the potential to be that bridge in an area where very few exist. 
The U.S. support would strengthen collaboration and provide 
encouragement for all of the countries in the region.
  I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this en bloc 
package.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, before I introduce the next speaker, I just 
want to say a few words about SESAME, because it is an extraordinary 
project, and I thank the gentleman for bringing it to this body's 
attention.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
Cohen).

                              {time}  1600

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Lowey for yielding. I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak.
  In this en bloc amendment, there are four amendments that I offered. 
I have offered them for 4 years. They have been accepted, now, for 2 
years. They are emoluments amendments. They will say we can't spend 
money at businesses that the President owns.
  Well, we shouldn't. No President should be in the business of getting 
money from the government, and it wasn't until Donald Trump became 
President that this became a problem.
  He does it at his hotels. He does it at his golf clubs. He has done 
it having airplanes stop at different airports than they normally do 
for refueling so they will end up having to spend the night at his golf 
club in Scotland. And recently, it came up that he asked his Ambassador 
to England to get one of his golf clubs in Scotland the opportunity to 
host the British Open and make a ton of money.
  The Presidency should be about serving the country and serving the 
people and supporting democracy, not about supporting yourself and 
putting money in your pocket.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this en bloc 
package, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentlewoman 
for her generosity and for recognizing the importance of the work that 
we are doing.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to my amendments and thank the Rules 
Committee for these amendments. I guess I have to speak very quickly.
  We have been committed over the years to stopping the trafficking of 
endangered species, and I am glad that I have established a focus on 
protecting the endangered species like Cecil the lion.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules Committee for that amendment, as well 
as the amendment that I have been working on for many years to stop 
female genital mutilation, to highlight the extensive amount of 
mutilation in developing nations across the world.
  I was also very pleased to have an amendment that provided for the 
authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or any Federal agency, to 
stop them from eliminating assistance and benefits to victims of 
trafficking as permitted by 22 U.S.C. 7105.
  We know that victims of human trafficking are the most vulnerable, 
and my city of Houston has been the epicenter of human trafficking.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to also applaud the fact that I 
was able to get an amendment in that increases the funding by $2 
million, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for the 1890s 
land-grant colleges, which are 28 historically Black colleges. It helps 
those who are in food deserts.
  And, Mr. Speaker, my district has now some percentage of COVID-19 who 
are, in essence, underwater, suffering, and food distribution, or the 
lack of food, is very evident.
  We have suffered in my region with toxic poisoning from chemicals, 
and we now have $5 million that has been in the Department of the 
Interior to highlight the need to support culturally competent Federal, 
State, and local public health and environmental protection efforts.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Fifth Ward Texas that they have been 
heard in the Halls of the United States Congress; they will not any 
longer be contaminated by creosote and having the numbers of cancers 
that they have experienced, as I have knocked on doors and had people 
telling me about their families dying because the railroad's creosote 
contaminated their backyards and the trees that they grew and the fruit 
that they grew.
  How horrendous that we would have that.
  I am very glad that our amendments were included in this legislation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again 
expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Texas.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the chairwoman has been enormously 
gracious for me to be able to conclude my remarks by indicating again 
the importance of the historically Black colleges getting an extra $2 
million; emphasizing that Fifth Ward Texas, the home of Barbara Jordan 
and Mickey Leland, older neighborhoods in the historically minority 
communities, won't suffer any longer by toxic poisoning because of 
chemicals that have been placed without care; and to be able to thank 
them, as well, for taking care of the endangered species and those who 
are trafficked and those, as well, with female genital mutilation.
  Mr. Speaker, I close my remarks by simply saying the COVID-19 dollars 
are needed. I thank the chairwoman for that. We are suffering in 
Houston, and we are going to fight to stop community spread by more 
testing, more testing, more testing.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Carbajal).
  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding to 
me.
  I rise in support of an amendment that includes a provision I 
coauthored with Representative Panetta to send a clear message to this 
administration that our public lands are not for sale.
  We will not put the interests of Big Oil over our people and sit idly 
by as the Trump administration seeks to open up the Carrizo Plain 
National Monument and other public lands in my district for oil and gas 
development.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, my amendment will direct $4,000,000 within 
the International Border and Water Commission to clarify the 
responsibility for the maintenance of the International Outfall 
Interceptor (IOI). This is in addition to, and separate from, the 
funding that currently exists for the long overdue repairs to the IOI.
  The International Outfall Interceptor is the infrastructure that 
transports wastewater from Sonora, Mexico and Arizona to the Nogales 
International Wastewater Treatment Plant.
  The IOI pipeline covers approximately 8.5 miles. Under a 1944 water 
utilization treaty, Mexico can treat water in the United States. The 
International Border and Water Commission is tasked with managing 
international infrastructure negotiations and operates the Nogales 
International Sanitation Project.
  On average, 92 percent of the water treated daily at the Nogales 
International Wastewater Treatment Plant is from Mexico and 8 percent 
from the surrounding community.
  Unfortunately, due to damage and aging infrastructure, the 
International Outfall Interceptor needs costly and urgent repairs. 
Wastewater constantly emerges from the IOI and pollutes surrounding 
rivers and streams. Rains carry the polluted stormwater into Nogales, 
Arizona and exposes downstream populations to extraordinary public 
health risk.
  In 2017, I called on the Governor of Arizona to commence the Disaster 
Declaration process for the State of Arizona to secure immediate 
federal assistance to remedy and prevent raw sewage exposure to Arizona 
residents.

[[Page H3817]]

  Every year during the monsoon season the health of residents along 
the Arizona southern border are put at risk, due to this ongoing issue. 
While Arizona residents are very familiar with this issue, other 
communities along the United States-Mexico border experience similar 
health risks due to similar issues.
  The IBWC has finalized engineering plans and already identified an 
existing $34.2 million to begin the urgent repairs to the IOI. My 
amendment further directs $4,000,000 within the International Border 
and Water Commission to clarify the responsibility to sustain the 
maintenance and operation of the International Outfall Interceptor 
(IOI).
  This has been an ongoing international issue that impacts the safety 
and well-being of communities across Southern Arizona. In the past, 
Senators and Member of Congress on both sides of the aisle of the 
Arizona delegation have collaborated to remedy the situation. I would 
like to thank Senator McSally for championing this issue in the Senate.
  I would like to thank the Chairwoman and the committee for their work 
on this bill. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this amendment, 
and I would urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. We must 
finally find a solution to protect the health of residents along the 
United States-Mexico border.
  Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for 
amendment No. 33 to H.R. 7608, the Department of State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 
2021. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come together to 
support this amendment, which should appropriate $1.4 million in 
foreign aid for ongoing humanitarian demining in Nagorno Karabakh--
Artsakh.
  USAID's demining program has eliminated nearly 4,000 landmines and 
over 57,000 items of unexploded ordnance, saving many lives from these 
remnants of war. The program has also transformed over 62,000 acres of 
former minefield and battlefield into land that can be used 
productively.
  However, we know that significant landmine contamination remains. 
Nagomo Karabakh has suffered from one of the worst mine accident rates 
in the world, with nearly 400 civilian casualties since 1994--a quarter 
of which have been children. Just last month an 11-year old boy named 
Hovannes found a submunition while digging in his family's garden. 
Because Hovannes had received U.S.-funded mine risk education about how 
to identify the weapon and stay safe, he told his family about the 
item, who contacted the U.S. demining program. The submunition was 
safely removed the next day.
  Continued funding for the demining program will unquestionably save 
lives and generate peace and stability in the region. The United 
States' demining program in Nagomo Karabakh represents the only source 
of U.S. support in the region, and the only demining assistance 
available to the families of Karabakh. Without an appropriation of $1.4 
million, the U.S. demining program will close, and families in the 
region, who are still waiting for their land to be made safe, will 
suffer indefinitely--families that are of utmost importance to the many 
Armenian American communities in my district and throughout our nation.
  Landmine clearance is a bipartisan U.S. priority that will provide 
critical humanitarian relief to countless families in Nagomo Karabakh 
who continue to live in constant threat of danger. I urge my colleagues 
to support this amendment and help provide much needed stability to 
this region, while continuing to support a constructive relationship 
between the U.S., Nagomo Karabakh, and Armenia.
  Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 
7608, which highlights the contributions of Vietnamese, Laotian, and 
Cambodian immigrants and discourages attempts to increase repatriations 
to those countries.
  In 2008, the United States reached a formal agreement with Vietnam 
which contains specific restrictions on the repatriation of certain 
individuals to Vietnam. Under this agreement, any Vietnamese national 
who arrived in the United States before our two nations established 
formal diplomatic relations on July 12, 1995 is barred from being 
repatriated to Vietnam. This provision benefits our communities by 
keeping families together and allowing people who have lived here for 
decades to continue making a positive impact on their communities. 
Under this Administration, there has been a renewed push to increase 
deportations to Southeast Asian countries, including the weaponization 
of visa sanctions to unilaterally push for broadened repatriation 
agreements.
  I am proud to represent a community where we honor the thousands of 
men, women, and children who arrived in the United States after the 
Vietnam War in search of a better life, and I call upon this 
Administration to cease attempts to renegotiate repatriation agreements 
to allow for greater numbers of repatriations to these countries.
  I would like to thank Chairwoman Lowey and the House Committee on 
Appropriations for including report language we requested to prevent 
the use of funds to negotiate or enter into an agreement with the 
Governments of Laos or Vietnam for the repatriation of these 
individuals. I also would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives 
Alan Lowenthal, Lou Correa, and Zoe Lofgren, for their support of this 
amendment and their continued hard work on behalf of Vietnamese and 
Southeast Asian American communities.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 84 to H.R. 7608, the State, Foreign 
Operations, Agriculture, Rural Development, Interior, Environment, 
Military Construction, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.
  I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for making this 
Jackson Lee amendment in order for House consideration of H.R. 7608.
  This Jackson Lee Amendment is straightforward and makes the bill even 
better. I believe they would command the support of a majority of the 
House and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of them.
  The amendment is to Division C--Department of the Interior, 
Environment.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 84 provides $5 million to highlight the 
need to support culturally competent federal, state, and local public 
health and environmental protection efforts to address cancer clusters 
impacting overburdened communities in the gulf coast region, which is 
home to a refinery row that runs from Mobile to Houston Texas.
  In the 18th Congressional District Creosote contamination in my 
district has had long term consequences for the residents of the 5th 
Ward.
  I have worked for years to address Environmental Justice issues in 
and around my District, by bringing agencies and communities together 
for meaningful dialogues.
  In April of 2019, I held a meeting between residents, local public 
health and Union Pacific Railroad regarding contamination in the 5th 
Ward area of Houston. Predecessor R.R. was South Pacific
  The meeting was to discuss letters that Union Pacific sent to 
residents informing them that they could not dig water wells in their 
yards due to creosote contamination.
  During this meeting residents expressed frustration at not getting 
questions answered regarding their concerns about the safety of water 
and soil due to the contamination and the alarming number of cancers 
occurring among residents.
  After hearing the discussion, I asked about a study to investigate 
the situation and provide answers to residents.
  A cancer cluster study was performed by the Texas Department of State 
Health Services and found that there is a higher incidence of certain 
types of cancers and cancer deaths among residents of Kashmere Gardens 
and the Fifth Ward.
  Southern Pacific operated the open pit of creosote in the residential 
area that treated railroad ties and light post for decades.
  Southern Pacific was acquired by Union Pacific, which continued to 
operate a wood treatment facility, dipping railroad ties in the 
preservative creosote.
  The creosote emitted fumes, leached into the soil and ran through 
ditches when it rained or flooded.
  Union Pacific closed their creosote treatment capacity, but the 
damage remained, because creosote is comprised of chemicals that in 
combination are listed as a hazardous substance by the Environmental 
Protection Agency.
  To address the contamination Union Pacific requested and approved 
largely to leave the contamination in the ground without pursuing more 
extensive cleanup efforts, which has left residents battling to get 
regulators to force the company to take more responsibility for the 
thick mass of creosote that lurks beneath their properties.
  These residents are right--the soil and water are killing them with 
cancer and Union Pacific has got to take strong action to remove this 
clear health threat that is causing cancers of the:
  Lung and Bronchus;
  Esophagus;
  Larynx (throat);
  Liver; and
  Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
  Rare is the case that a community meeting results in such a profound 
finding that and exposed an urgent need that should be addressed given 
the science behind the causes of cancer and the steps that much be 
taken to limit risks.
  There are other communities throughout the Gulf Coast that may have 
creosote contamination linked to old railroad lines that may not be 
given the level of attention needed to address health risks.
  Funding provided by this amendment will provide resources for those 
communities with cancer clusters.

  I ask for your support for this Jackson Lee Amendment, which is 
needed to save lives.
  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc Amendment No. 2 
which includes my amendment number 17 to the State and Foreign 
Operations division to provide an additional $5 million for U.S. 
demining activities.
  Mr. Speaker, antipersonnel landmines continue to injure and kill 
thousands of men. women. and children every year. These devices arc 
indiscriminate and can explode years or even decades after wars are 
ended and peace agreements are signed. All it takes is for a car to 
pass or a person to walk over the wrong place at the wrong time to 
devastate a life and a family.
  Thankfully, there are a number of humanitarian organizations that arc 
working tirelessly to find and safely remove these explosives. 
Unfortunately, despite their valiant efforts, there still remain many 
more antipersonnel landmines to be found and neutralized. I have had 
the opportunity to examine the impact of landmines in places like 
Lebanon, Somalia and Egypt, and believe that the United States has a 
moral obligation to do all it can to support demining efforts, and that 
is why I sought this increase.
  I was proud to work with the Appropriations Committee in 2006 to get 
an increase of $10 million to the State Department's Humanitarian 
Demining account and am grateful that it has accepted my amendment for 
an increase of $5 million to this year's appropriations bill. This 
additional funding will save countless more lives and spare thousands 
from having to live with devastating injuries.
  I would like to thank Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Lowey and 
Ranking member Granger for including this amendment in the en bloc.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question 
is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. Lowey).

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

(Ms. Granger) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. Granger), the ranking member, for yielding.
  I rise today in support of my amendment to enhance conditions on our 
aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces, LAF.
  Mr. Speaker, Lebanon has historically been an appreciated partner of 
the United States in the Middle East and a wonderful example of 
pluralism and democracy.
  Having witnessed decades of occupation by the brutal Assad regime in 
Syria, father and son, Lebanon saw the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 
2005 after the Lebanese people rose up in the March 15 Cedar Revolution 
to demand their sovereignty and freedom.
  Unfortunately, however, the gains made by the Cedar Revolution have 
been lost in recent years. The Lebanese people continue to protest in 
the streets for their rights to a democratic, nonsectarian, noncorrupt 
government. However, disturbingly, the LAF have worked to put down the 
protests, arresting protesters and committing human rights violations.
  The LAF has also done nothing as Hezbollah builds precision-guided 
missiles and cross-border tunnel infrastructure to attack Israel in 
defiance of U.S. resolutions; yet, U.S. taxpayers continue to fund the 
LAF with over $100 million each year.
  This aid was surely warranted in previous years during previous 
Lebanese Governments, but with the new government, the situation has 
changed, and U.S. policies should change accordingly.

[[Page H3819]]

  It is time to stand with the people of Lebanon and Syria and ensure 
that U.S. tax dollars are not going to a military hijacked by a 
terrorist organization and committing human rights violations.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, 
and I claim time in opposition.
  There are many things in this en bloc that I oppose, and I could 
speak to each issue, but I want to reserve my comments for the attack 
on climate change.
  Most of us, even my friends across the aisle, agree that climate 
change is a real global threat. Our military also believes this.
  I cannot emphasize enough that climate change is exacerbating the 
root causes of conflict. We will see an increasing demand on our 
humanitarian aid and other resources if we do not address it now.
  Prohibiting U.S. contributions to the multilaterals that combat 
climate change is a shortsighted, harmful policy that does not prepare 
our country to face this threat.
  We cannot afford to stand idly by while others address climate 
change. We already feel its effects. We should not be alienating 
multilateral partners. We need to join the fight.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. Gosar).
  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Granger) for yielding and for all her hard work on the committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc package. I 
particularly want to highlight my two amendments, both of which protect 
integral Trump administration executive orders.
  The first protects Executive Order 13807, which pertains to 
streamlining environmental review and permitting processes for 
infrastructure projects. This executive order was the basis for new 
NEPA regulations that the Trump administration announced just last 
week.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to get back to building things in this country. 
It seems every week is like groundhog week, it is infrastructure week, 
but if we are serious about addressing the problems with our aging 
infrastructure, we must get serious about modernizing outdated 
processes that unnecessarily slow down infrastructure projects.
  Whether it is offshore wind, building electrical transition lines, or 
building solar energy projects on public lands, outdated regulations 
cause countless delays and cancellations of these important projects, 
costing jobs and economic opportunity for our constituents.
  My second amendment protects Executive Order 13817, which directs the 
Federal Government to develop a strategy to ensure a secure and 
reliable supply of critical minerals.
  The facts are, Mr. Speaker, that we are completely reliant on China 
for 20 critical minerals that go into producing everything from parts 
for fighter jets to cellphones.

  Cobalt is a great example of the dangers of becoming reliant on China 
to meet these mineral needs. Sixty percent of the cobalt supply is 
mined in the Congo, where abhorrent child labor practices are well 
documented, and China now controls at least half of all cobalt 
production in that country.
  Fortunately, the proposed Twin Metals mine would serve as a rare 
source of domestic cobalt, but, of course, my colleagues aim to shut 
that project down as well by including language in this bill aimed at 
preventing this project.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to wake up and face the facts. We 
must harvest our own domestic resources and ingenuity before it is too 
late. Our long-term economic, energy, and national security depend upon 
it, even the climate change the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) 
talked about.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Panetta).
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding.
  I rise today to offer an amendment to prohibit funds from being used 
to open up new Federal lands to oil and gas drilling in my and my 
neighboring district on the central coast of California. Based on 
recent orders, this administration would use those Federal lands to 
extract natural resources rather than explore their natural wonders.
  In my district, our economy and well-being are intrinsically tied to 
our environment. That is why we have taken critical steps to invest in 
clean infrastructure rather than new leases for fossil fuels. That is 
because we feel strongly that our public lands are not disposable and 
should not be disrupted.
  That is why I offered this amendment, and that is why I will continue 
to fight to safeguard our Federal public lands.

                              {time}  1615

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).
  (Mr. DUNCAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment which 
strikes harmful language in the underlying bill that would prevent any 
funding to be used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to process 
permits for lawfully sport-hunted trophies from the countries of 
Tanzania, Zimbabwe, or Zambia.
  Sportsmen groups and conservation groups, both here at home in 
America and internationally, all agree that well-regulated hunting in 
the countries affected by the shortsighted language found in section 
436 of the underlying bill, is just reckless pandering to special-
interest animal rights groups.
  The irony is this language will have an adverse effect and hurt 
populations of the remaining wild lions and elephants which these 
emotionally driven, science deniers claim to be advocating for.
  But what about those who live and work in the countries affected by 
this legislation? How do they feel about this Congress mindlessly 
targeting their livelihoods?
  Well, it may come as a great shock to those on the other side of the 
aisle, but just this week a letter was sent to the Speaker of the House 
by local representatives of millions of rural Africans who object to 
this attack on their basic human right to sustainably use their natural 
resources on which their communities' livelihoods depend.
  They understand, better than the folks here in this body, that 
sustainable hunting practices which they utilize lead not only to 
benefits for their wildlife populations and their ecosystems, but to 
the betterment of their fellow man and their communities.
  In many cases, the population of these species exceed the carrying 
capacity of their habitats. If left unmanaged, they threaten the viable 
habitats as well as the safety of humans in these rural areas.
  Experts, including scientific and management authorities in those 
countries, the parties to the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the International Union for 
Conservation of Nature, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, credit 
sustainable hunting programs as a cornerstone of the successful 
conservation and wildlife management strategies that are responsible 
for these wildlife populations. Any law that discourages, rather than 
facilitates, these hunting programs will have an adverse impact on 
sound ecosystem conservation.
  The language, which this amendment will strike, is not backed by 
science. To the contrary, the best conservation science clearly shows 
that populations of lions and elephants in the affected countries are 
some of the highest found anywhere on the entire continent.
  Mr. Speaker, it is for these reasons I urge adoption of this 
amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on 
Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment 
to address Congresswoman Miller and Congressman King's amendments in 
the en bloc. Their amendments would strike provisions of the bill that 
block the administration from diverting funds from critical military 
construction projects to the border wall.

[[Page H3820]]

  The bill also prohibits the administration from backfilling projects 
in fiscal years 2016 to 2020 that were previously canceled for 
construction of the border wall, and the amendments strike that 
provision as well.
  Stealing military construction funds from the intended purpose has a 
direct impact on military readiness, compromises our national security, 
and the safety and welfare of servicemembers and their families.
  Thirty percent of the Department of Defense infrastructure, according 
to the Department of Defense, is in poor or failing condition. The 
military construction funds provided and approved by Congress were 
intended for specific projects as requested by the services.
  To support these two amendments is to declare that catering to 
xenophobia is more important than making sure we have the best fighting 
force in the world.
  The amendments in question seek to grant the President the power of a 
monarch and allow him to steal funding from our troops and bypass 
Congress at will.
  I thought Mexico was supposed to pay for the border wall. Instead, 
these amendments ask our heroes in uniform to pay for it. We have to 
take a stand against that, and we do that in this bill.
  We stand up for our troops. These amendments steal from our troops. I 
ask my colleagues to vote against the en bloc amendment.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).
  Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of three 
amendments I have submitted in the Republican en bloc.
  An amendment to stop my colleagues across the aisle from cutting 
funding for our border wall. We still have a crisis on our southern 
border, and we need to stop illegal drugs from entering our country.
  An amendment to support innovation in the gas industry. American 
energy is clean, affordable, and efficient. We must capitalize on our 
American energy dominance to rebuild our economy, expand trade, and 
create stable jobs.
  And an amendment to make sure our police remain funded. We cannot let 
our liberal colleagues defund the police. This overcorrection will lead 
our country to a dark place. Our police officers protect our 
communities and keep us safe. I am proud to support our police.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Tlaib). Welcome to her children, too.
  Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment, 
which increases funds for lead drinking water pipe replacement by $500 
million, to a total of $1 billion.

  This amendment is an investment to remove the 6 to 10 million lead 
service lines that contaminate our tap water across our Nation, and the 
over 600,000 lines alone in Michigan.
  Contaminated water is a fact of life for Michigan's 13th 
Congressional District. Too many of our families and communities are 
suffering, and it is time we step up our investments to guarantee 
environmental justice for all.
  I thank Chairwoman McCollum for working with me on this amendment to 
secure historic funding to replace lead pipes. And I also thank my 
colleagues, Representatives Kildee and Slotkin for their partnership on 
this.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).
  Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of 
Representative Duncan's amendment to strike from the bill section 436, 
which prohibits the issuance of an import permit for a sport-hunted 
trophy of an elephant or lion taken in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, or Zambia.
  Simply put, this import prohibition would harm the economic 
development of African countries and put the wildlife and habitat in 
those countries at risk.
  This is exactly what the Zambian Foreign Minister told me when I met 
with him:
  Regulated, sustainable hunting can be used for economic development 
just like any other natural resource. And in the vast majority of 
instances, hunting revenue and game fees are the greatest and most 
accessible asset for rural people.
  By creating a market for regulated hunting of these animals, African 
countries promote conservation and undermine incentives for illegal 
poaching.
  A U.S. import ban undermines those markets in African countries, 
which perpetuates unsustainable poaching, underground markets, poverty, 
and economic underdevelopment.
  The individuals who seek to prevent African countries from 
responsibly using their natural resources are the same who strive to 
end the production of agriculture in States like North Dakota.
  They impart a flawed moral view on others without understanding the 
economic and cultural ramifications that harm the communities that 
produce these resources. It is paternalistic and, quite frankly, it is 
condescending and, in fact, counterproductive to a robust conservation 
of the magnificent animals and the habitat in which those animals live.
  Hunters and sportsmen are truly the world's best conservationists, 
and the resources we deploy go toward anti-poaching programs; defend 
against destruction of vital habitat; and incentivize local communities 
to come together to protect their wildlife.
  I urge the adoption of the Duncan amendment, which will promote 
sustainable hunting markets with African countries.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).
  Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Ms. Granger 
from Texas.
  I have three amendments included in this en bloc amendment.
  The first one prohibits any funds in the State and Foreign Ops 
Division from being provided to the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency, UNRWA.
  In 2018, President Trump made the correct decision to defund UNRWA. 
Unfortunately, this bill seeks to reverse course and provide funding to 
this organization.
  I remind everybody, this organization, rather than pursuing its 
mission, chooses to foster and promote and anti-Semitism and violence 
against Israelis. In spite of repeated demands by the U.S., UNRWA 
continues this kind of abhorrent behavior.
  The second amendment prohibits the EPA from using funds in this bill 
to take retaliatory actions against States that fall short of the EPA-
mandated Chesapeake Bay TMDL.
  In 2010, the EPA seized the States' authority to determine their own 
method of compliance and threatened to take over the water quality 
plans if the States failed to comply.
  These coercive measures have been tried and have failed. Water 
quality has not improved since the federalization of the Bay clean-up 
efforts. Preventing EPA from taking retaliatory action is imperative to 
the success of these efforts.
  The final one prohibits the EPA from using funds pursuant to Section 
115 of the Clean Air Act.
  Section 115 of the Clean Air Act allows the EPA to mandate State 
emissions levels to whatever level the agency deems appropriate: if 
they find emissions endanger a foreign nation; and the endangered 
nation has a reciprocal agreement to prevent or control these emissions 
in their own nation.
  I urge adoption of these amendments.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, on the last day of the Obama-
Biden administration, Fish and Wildlife issued a ``Director's Order'' 
setting in place an almost total ban on lead ammunition and tackle on 
Federal lands.
  While Fish and Wildlife claimed that the rule was based on science, 
we know clearly it was not. The decision by the Obama-Biden 
administration was made solely to limit access to public land of 
sportsmen and fishermen.
  As soon as I was made aware of this midnight rule, I worked with the 
incoming Trump administration to get it overturned. Fortunately, 
President

[[Page H3821]]

Trump acted quickly to undo this disastrous order. And since then he 
has only taken steps to increase access to public lands for sportsmen 
and fishermen alike.
  Since President Trump's actions, Congress has taken additional steps 
to prevent the regulation of ammunition and tackle for sportsmen. 
Unfortunately, Democrats have decided to abandon the precedent.

  My amendment simply reinstates a policy that Congress has carried in 
a bipartisan fashion for the past several years and continues support 
for the rights of sportsmen to access public land for recreational 
purposes.
  I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. King).
  Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment.
  What it does is, it sees that in the underlying legislation there is 
language that strikes the President's ability to use the resources 
within the Department of Defense budget to build a wall or a road along 
the southern border. It would be a mistake to take that language out 
and--to have that language in there. We need to take the language out 
and let the President have the discretion to make these decisions. He 
has a mandate from the American people.
  The southern border is such a risk that 80 to 90 percent of the 
illegal drugs coming through into the United States come from or 
through Mexico; 70,000 drug overdose deaths; the violence that comes 
from it; tens of millions of illegal aliens in America, and we have 
seen unemployment numbers in this country as high as 40 million 
throughout this COVID epidemic.
  So to tie the President's hands and to take away the resources he has 
in front of him now, because it essentially says, no funds heretofore 
appropriated may be used either for a wall or a road.
  I would say also that I came to this floor and from this very podium 
in 2006 with a model that demonstrated how easy it was to build a wall 
on the southern border. It is cost effective, and it preserves our 
security. This amendment gives the President back the authority to 
continue the construction of the wall.
  Madam Speaker, I urge its adoption.

                              {time}  1630

  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Resolution 1060, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en 
bloc offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.

965, the yeas and nays are ordered.

                 Amendment No. 62 Offered by Mr. Allen

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
62 printed in House Report 116-459.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division C (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. ___.  Each amount made available by this Act (other 
     than an amount required to be made available by a provision 
     of law) is hereby reduced by 5 percent.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, this bill that we are debating here is a 
partisan travesty and spends entirely more than this government can 
afford. That is why I rise again today to offer an amendment to cut 
spending to the Interior and Environment portion of the bill.
  In addition to its overspending, this bill attempts to delegitimize 
President Trump's replacement for the Obama administration's 
overreaching WOTUS rule. The farmers and landowners in my district will 
tell you how devastating that would be.
  It continues down the path that the far left have been touting this 
entire Congress, implementing socialist Green New Deal policies 
disguised as emergency funding, but this couldn't be further from the 
truth. This bill not only spends more of Americans' taxpayer dollars, 
but forces others to spend more, forcing onerous regulations on 
American business owners that would ultimately lead to higher costs for 
our American families.
  Continuing to adhere to the Obama administration's outdated and 
repressive regulations would be detrimental not only to the energy 
sector workers, but to millions of American families whose budgets 
depend on affordable and reliable fuel and natural gas, and would 
jeopardize America's energy independence.
  Today's minibus totals $219.6 billion in discretionary spending, plus 
another $37.5 billion in emergency spending, busting the budget 
agreement and increasing funds in the form of BCA cap-exempt funding, 
with almost a third of the funding of this division not subject to the 
BCA caps.
  And let me remind you that under the Democratic majority, we can't

[[Page H3824]]

even stick to the budget that was agreed to. The Interior and 
Environment division would provide funding at a whopping 41.4 percent 
above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and 59 percent over the 
President's request.
  While the President's budget proposed to reduce or eliminate programs 
in the EPA that are better left to States, communities, and private 
individuals, the House's proposal for Interior and Environment 
maintains or increases spending on EPA programs.
  I am a former business owner, and just like any good business owner 
or family knows, you must operate within a budget and make tough 
choices to live within your means. As Members of the people's House, we 
must hold ourselves to the same standard that American workers and 
families do. My simple amendment is a good place to start.

                              {time}  1845

  My amendment would reduce interior and environmental spending by 5 
percent for fiscal year 2021. I am going to do some quick math for you. 
My amendment would cut about $2.7 billion.
  Even with my 5 percent cut, this division would still dramatically 
increase spending for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. To 
be honest, I wish we could cut more, but this is a place that I believe 
we can start.
  Even with my amendment, we still will be spending a lot of taxpayer 
dollars, so I believe my Democratic colleagues could easily support 
this.
  Our national debt crisis can no longer be ignored, and my colleagues 
must take a serious look at Washington spending in order to start 
taking back control.
  Madam Speaker, earlier today I mentioned my 13 beautiful 
grandchildren, and I am excited that we have another one on the way. I 
believe it is all of our duties to do everything possible to avoid 
placing a $26 trillion, and growing, national debt burden on the backs 
of the next generation.
  My amendment is just a small, first step toward bringing fiscal 
responsibility back to Washington.
  I urge all of my colleagues in this body to support my amendment 
today.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, this amendment indiscriminately cuts 
programs in this bill, not giving one bit of thought to the merit of 
the program within the bill that it would cut.
  For instance, it would cut--well, it would cut the Indian Health 
Service, and that would mean fewer patients seen, especially during the 
COVID pandemic, which we know has affected the Native American 
population in a very dramatic, painful, and hurtful way.
  It would mean fewer safety inspectors, ensuring that accidents and 
oil spills do not occur, which means endangering the lives of oil rig 
workers and our environment.
  It would worsen our Nation's drinking water and sanitation 
infrastructure deferred maintenance problem, which means more children 
would be exposed to lead in their drinking water.
  More generally, investments in our environmental infrastructure and 
our public lands would be halted, and the associated jobs would be 
lost, jobs Americans desperately need.
  More importantly, this amendment, as I said, would contribute to 
lives being lost in Indian Country. And I do not say that lightly, 
Madam Speaker. Tribes are being particularly hard-hit by the 
coronavirus, and this amendment would only compound the problem.
  And let me tell you a little more about what critical programs would 
be cut in Indian Country. It would mean cuts to basic healthcare and 
diabetes programs. It would mean cuts to child and maternal health. As 
we know, our Native brothers and sisters--my Native sisters in 
particular, suffer high infant mortality rates. It would mean cuts to 
mental health service at a time when this population in our country, 
the indigenous people, who were here first, would be suffering even 
more than they are today with the mental health crisis, as they cannot 
go to their customs and traditions when mourning the loss of lives 
because of not being able to gather.
  It has been a nonpartisan goal of the Committee on Appropriations--a 
nonpartisan goal of this entire body--to work to improve the health 
status of our Native American brothers and sisters. This amendment guts 
those efforts. It will set Indiana Country back. I dare say, it could 
set Indian Country back by decades, because we have so much more work 
to do to address the health disparity.
  This amendment would not encourage agencies to do more with less. It 
would simply force agencies, and especially those serving our Native 
American Nations, to do less for their Tribal members, less healthcare.
  So I urge Members to strongly oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, let me try to understand what we are saying here. We 
have a $25 trillion or $26 trillion and growing debt in this country. I 
mean, is there no concern for future generations?
  And when you look at the explosion of this debt--I mean, when I saw 
the appropriations package, I could not believe it. I mean, we can't 
even live within a budget? I mean, what kind of message are we sending 
to our children and grandchildren here?
  We can't leave them with an insurmountable debt simply because we as 
a body refuse to take some commonsense steps to take back control of 
this spending. We can't even cut 5 percent?
  I am deeply concerned about the future of this country, and I urge a 
``yes'' vote on my amendment today.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, once again, this is an across-the-board indiscriminate 
cut. We all might agree that there are programs and activities that 
take place in these bills that we could see a cut with. But this is an 
across-the-board 5 percent cut, which will deeply, deeply affect the 
gains that we have been struggling to make in a nonpartisan way in 
Indian Country, and I simply cannot be silent while that happens.
  We have to do what we can do to make sure that the treaty and 
obligations that this United States Government entered into with the 
First Nations, who were here first, are honored, and part of that is 
healthcare.
  Madam Speaker, I ask others to join me to oppose this amendment, 
which if passed, will harm the American people and do, in my opinion, 
irreparable damage to the healthcare and education of our Native 
American brothers and sisters.
  I oppose this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to join me.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. Allen).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question

  The Chair understands that amendment No. 66 will not be offered.


                 Amendment No. 67 offered by Mr. Tonko

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
67 printed in House Report 116-459.
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, as the designee of Ms. Blunt Rochester, I 
have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division C of the bill (before the short 
     title) insert the following:
       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may 
     be used to finalize, implement, or enforce the proposed rule 
     titled ``Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
     for Particulate Matter'' published in the Federal Register by 
     the Environmental Protection Agency on April 30, 2020 (85 
     Fed. Reg. 24094 et seq.).

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today as the designee of my very good friend, 
Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, to offer and support this amendment.
  Every person deserves to breathe clean air. As we battle a global 
public health pandemic, that truth could not be more important.
  Time and time again, the administration has chosen to ignore the 
latest public health science, allowing our air to remain polluted and 
our communities to be less safe.
  The EPA's most recent failure to propose air quality standards that 
will protect human health is unacceptable, and it will put tens of 
thousands of lives at risk.
  Fine particulate matter, commonly known as soot, is a dangerous 
pollutant. In particular, it puts low wealth and communities of color 
at greatest risk. These are the communities that are already 
experiencing staggering death rates from COVID-19, made worse by 
decades of exposure to toxic pollution.
  The EPA has chosen to retain its existing inadequate standard, 
despite ample peer-reviewed studies clearly showing that a stronger 
standard is, indeed, justified.
  Even the EPA's own more limited assessment of the health impacts 
calculated that strengthening the standard would prevent thousands of 
premature deaths.
  This amendment is simple. It would prohibit the EPA from finalizing 
its insufficiently protective review of the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards for particulate matter.
  The American people need an Environmental Protection Agency that will 
listen to doctors and scientists and take the steps necessary to 
protect the health and well-being of all Americans, regardless of their 
race, income, or ZIP Code.
  We are in the midst of a global health pandemic. Protecting our 
health could not be more important than at this very moment.
  I, indeed, urge my colleagues to support this amendment and give the 
EPA the opportunity to finalize a stronger standard that will actually 
protect human health and the environment.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. Joyce), my colleague and friend.
  Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. This amendment interferes with an already rigorous 
scientific and public review process before the process has even been 
completed.
  The public comment period closed less than a month ago, and the EPA 
is in the process of considering more than 66,000 public comments 
received and making corresponding changes to the proposal.
  The EPA's proposal to maintain the standards set by President Obama 
comes after careful consideration of the most current available 
scientific evidence and risk and exposure information and with 
consultation and confirmation by the agency's independent science 
advisors.
  By maintaining the current national particulate matter standard, the 
EPA continues to protect our environment and the health of the American 
citizens without placing additional burdens on communities.
  There already too many States and counties currently struggling to 
meet the current standards, which are already among the strictest 
safeguards in the world. For these areas of our Nation, the solution is 
to help them meet the bar, not raise the bar.
  The EPA remains publicly committed to helping these areas succeed, 
and to Chair McCollum's credit, this bill gives the EPA the resources 
necessary to keep doing so.
  We are on the right track. The U.S. has made incredible strides in 
reducing particulate matter concentrations across the Nation. As a 
result of the Clean Air Act, programs and efforts by State, local, and 
Tribal Governments, as well as technological improvements, average fine 
particulate matter concentrations in the U.S. fell by 39 percent 
between 2000 and 2018, while average coarse particulate matter 
concentrations fell by 31 percent during the same period.
  Madam Speaker, the process that Congress created and continues to 
fund in this bill is working. Now it is our job to get out of the way.
  Vote ``no'' on the amendment, and let the EPA do its job.
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, who has the right to close?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has the right to 
close.
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, this amendment would prohibit the use of any funds to 
finalize or implement or enforce the EPA's recent proposal to maintain 
the current Particulate Matter National Air Ambient Quality Standard.
  In April of this year, the EPA proposed retaining the existing 
particulate matter standard. The standard is 12 micrograms per cubic 
meter of air. It was last reviewed and substantially tightened in 2013 
during the previous administration.
  The current EPA undertook the required 5-year review of the PM 
standard. In a resounding 5-to-1 decision, the EPA's Clean Air 
Scientific Advisory Committee voted to retain the standard.
  The CASAC determined that there were substantial uncertainties with 
studies alleging to demonstrate health effects below the current 
standard.
  Following the requirements of the regulatory process, the EPA 
conducted a science-based review and analysis of the relevant data, and 
it proposed retaining the current PM standards.
  So if I have this right, the EPA conducted a scientific review and 
analysis, it followed the requisite Administrative Procedures Act 
process, and it made a regulatory proposal which it still will take 
public comment on, review the feedback, and eventually make a final 
determination.
  So where is the misstep here that requires this kind of amendment? 
Did the agency falter by listening to science? Did the agency falter by 
following the rulemaking process?
  What this amendment does is replace EPA's science-based analysis and 
proposal with a politically motivated Congressional edict.

                              {time}  1900

  PM2.5 emissions have dropped 37 percent over the last two decades. 
Combined pollutant emissions have declined 74 percent since 1970. The 
U.S. has some of the lowest PM2.5 emissions in the world, including 
five times below the global average and seven times below Chinese 
levels, thanks to our rigorous Clean Air Act process.
  Our air is cleaner, and under this administration, our economy has 
simultaneously been stronger. Facts, science, and process, that is what 
we should be dictating our environmental regulatory process.
  Indeed, we should support a rigorous standard-setting process for the 
Clean Air Act. Getting this right is vital. Setting standards 
unnecessarily low is dangerous.
  The economic, social, and physical collapse of communities that 
follow when factories pull out or power plants close due to new 
standards profoundly harms families, especially the most vulnerable. 
Getting it right is exactly what is happening right now with the 
administration's proposals for particulate matter standards.
  The problem with my committee colleague's amendment is that it stops 
this important process in its tracks. It will deprive the public of the 
benefit of a sound science process to protect public health for all 
populations. Stopping the scientific process does not protect public 
health.
  Support for this amendment undermines the Clean Air Act. I urge a 
``no'' vote on this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I will close with this. For my colleagues who promote 
science, when you politically vote for science standards without the 
scientific process, you kind of destroy the

[[Page H3826]]

whole EPA process. With that, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this 
amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I will repeat. Every individual deserves 
the right to breathe clean air. Certainly, this pandemic has proven 
that certain areas, certain neighborhoods, certain populations, have 
been at risk. It has been proven by the impact that COVID-19 has borne 
on so many individuals and communities.
  I would like to thank Representatives Blunt Rochester, McEachin, and 
Rush for authorizing this important amendment and for their tireless 
work to achieve environmental justice in carrying out our Nation's 
environmental laws.
  Madam Speaker, I thank Chair McCollum of the Interior, Environment, 
and Related Agencies Subcommittee for her work on this great bill to 
protect public health and the environment.
  EPA has a requirement to put forward standards that are based on 
sound science and protective at the same time of human health. The PM 
proposal has failed to do so.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to 
ensure environmental protection extends to each and every American.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Tonko).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question

                Amendment No. 86 Offered by Mr. Kennedy

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
86 printed in House Report 116-459.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division C (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. _. (a) None of the funds made available by this Act 
     may be used to--
       (1) rescind the September 2015 Bureau of Indian Affairs 
     Record of Decision on the Trust Acquisition and Reservation 
     Proclamation for 151 Acres in the City of Taunton, 
     Massachusetts, and 170 Acres in the Town of Mashpee, 
     Massachusetts, for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe;
       (2) revoke the reservation proclamation Proclaiming Certain 
     Lands as Reservation for the Mashpee Wampanoag (81 Fed. Reg. 
     948); or
       (3) annul the determination that such lands are eligible 
     for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his leadership on 
this bill and for the support of this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, in 1620, 400 years ago, the Pilgrims settled on 
Wampanoag land in Plymouth, Massachusetts. For literally four 
centuries, the Mashpee Wampanoag people have been fighting for their 
sovereignty, for their land, and for their survival. And for 
generations, they have been met with resistance from a government that 
should be protecting and empowering them.
  In the last few months, Madam Speaker, their fight has arrived at a 
crossroads created by a Trump administration that has treated Tribes 
with nothing but contempt since the day of his inauguration.
  Because of decisions made by this administration, the Mashpee 
Wampanoag's land may be stolen from them again in the coming weeks.
  We have a responsibility to do what is right, to learn from the 
mistakes of generations before us, to recognize that this land wasn't 
land to be discovered or to be taken. It belonged to Tribes like the 
Mashpee long before the Pilgrims arrived.
  Madam Speaker, we need to pass this amendment to right the wrongs of 
the past, to prevent them from becoming the wrongs of the present.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman Arizona is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition, very strong 
opposition, to this amendment.
  The amendment continues the efforts in this House to halt enforcement 
of a Federal court action on this matter in order to build a massive 
400,000-square-foot off-reservation gaming complex for the benefit of 
Genting, a foreign Malaysian gaming company.
  Since we considered this legislation last year, there have been a 
number of important events, including just last month when the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Boston served a Federal grand jury subpoena to the 
Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe last month for a hefty number of documents and 
financial records.
  Yet, here we are once again, misguidedly considering the 
establishment of two separate reservations for the Mashpee Tribe of 
Massachusetts.
  One reservation will be the town of Mashpee, the Tribe's historic 
reservation lands. No casino will be allowed within ``the geographic 
boundaries of the town of Mashpee.''
  The other reservation will be 50 miles away from Mashpee in the city 
of Taunton. This site is not part of the Tribe's historic reservation 
and was selected by the Tribe and Genting for a billion-dollar casino 
project because of its proximity to the Providence, Rhode Island, 
casino market, a 20-mile distance.
  There is no reason for the second reservation other than to build an 
off-reservation casino 50 miles away from where the Mashpee Tribe 
currently resides.
  In 1988, Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act with the 
intent to restrict casinos to Tribes' original reservations in order to 
protect the States and the rights of citizens of those States.
  By placing land in trust for the Mashpee Tribe for gaming in Taunton, 
this amendment creates an off-reservation casino, which is inconsistent 
with congressional intent. This is often called reservation shopping, 
and it is an abuse of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
  Now, the Tribe's lawyers knew that reservation shopping was a 
political headache, so they went to bureaucrats within the BIA to 
obtain the two reservations through administrative action. But let's be 
honest, this isn't about the Mashpee Tribe. This is about Genting 
Malaysia. This amendment is really about just a financial bailout for 
Genting.
  The Tribe is swamped with more than $500-plus million in debt to 
Genting, and there is no way the Tribe can ever pay this back and still 
make enough money to sustain itself. Genting, therefore, will be the 
real owner of the project, not the Tribe.
  This kind of arrangement, where the creditor practically controls the 
financial futures of a debtor Tribe, is contrary to the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act, which requires every Tribal casino to be 100 percent 
tribally owned.
  Moreover, the American Principles Project reports on the ties between 
convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, 
stating, ``The expansive Abramoff investigation uncovered major 
corruption within the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. Its chief, Glenn 
Marshall, pled guilty in 2009 to multiple Federal charges, including 
embezzling Tribal funds and campaign finance violations committed while 
working with Abramoff to secure Federal recognition'' in 2007.
  This disastrous project has garnered its broad share of opposition, 
including President Trump, Democrats, and Republicans. The project is 
also strenuously opposed by the other federally recognized Tribe in 
Massachusetts.
  For Members on both sides of the aisle, do you really want your name 
tied to a Tribe that only received Federal recognition in 2007 as a 
result of shady lobbying by Jack Abramoff? Do

[[Page H3827]]

you really want to vote for a $500 million bailout for a foreign gaming 
corporation?
  More importantly, while everyone is innocent until proven guilty, 
prudence suggests that Congress wait until the completion of the 
ongoing Federal grand jury investigation before acting on any gambling 
legislation related to a foreign entity and an Indian Tribe that 
appears to be the target of that investigation.
  In short, this amendment attempts, once again, to force an off-
reservation casino, bails out a foreign corporation from major 
financial problems of its own making, undoes the judgment of a Federal 
court, and contradicts a Supreme Court ruling.

  Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of both sides of the aisle to vote 
against this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).
  Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I speak in favor of this amendment.
  On March 27, 2 weeks after the U.S. Government had declared a state 
of emergency due to the COVID-19 virus, leaders of the Mashpee 
Wampanoag Tribe, the Tribe that helped the Pilgrim forefathers survive 
the devastation of illness and starvation in their first winter, 
received a phone call from the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's office.
  Now, you would think that maybe they were going to see how the Tribe 
was doing, a Tribe that is disproportionately affected by the virus. 
Maybe they were calling to see if they needed any help. Regrettably, 
that wasn't the case.
  In an act with discretionary timing, and one of the most 
reprehensible acts I have witnessed since I have been here in this 
Congress, they were informing them that, on behalf the U.S. Government, 
they were taking away their land, their buildings, their medical 
center, and leaving them in financial ruins.
  Now, fortunately, the D.C. Circuit judge rebuffed this unconscionable 
act, calling it arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and unusually 
so, calling it an abuse of power.
  Now, due to the close relationship between the White House and the 
lobbying group that is dealing with this, this could rear its ugly head 
again.
  This amendment is different than the three that we passed before, in 
terms of legislation. It is much more narrow. All it does is make sure 
the Tribe, the Tribe which helped the Pilgrims survive their first 
year, is allowed to do so themselves in the coming year.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, once again, the facts are the facts. I know 
there are gut-wrenching applications. I dealt with Tribes my whole 
life. But the facts are the facts. This amendment is egregious. The 
facts are the facts.
  Two reservational applications is incomprehensible. It violates the 
very law that we actually passed.
  Now, if you disagree with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, be my 
guest, change it. But that is not what we do. We follow the law. The 
law is the law.
  Madam Speaker, with that, I would ask everybody to vote against this 
amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I stand today with my colleagues from 
Massachusetts in support of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and in support 
of Tribal sovereignty, and I ask my colleagues to pass this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment 
offered by my friend and colleague from Massachusetts.
  This amendment would effectively prevent the Department of Interior 
from moving forward with a decision to revoke tribal lands from being 
held in trust. Although I appreciate my colleague's advocacy on behalf 
of the tribe in his state, the tribal land trust process is based on 
complex legal precedent and has no business being included in a bill to 
fund the federal government. We are familiar with the complexities of 
tribal law in Rhode Island as the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri 
v. Salazar had implications for our state. But any legislative remedy 
for Carcieri shouldn't lie in an ad hoc approach that favors one 
particular tribe.
  What's more, this amendment could cause serious economic harm to 
Rhode Island. It effectively preserves the opportunity for the 
construction of a new casino in Taunton, Massachusetts, by putting 
pending administrative decisions on hold for the next year. My 
colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation are hoping for a last minute 
judicial or administrative reversal that would allow the stalled casino 
project to begin. The project would be in direct competition with 
established casinos just over the state line. Twin River and Tiverton 
casinos have been important economic drivers in my state, generating 
hundreds of millions of dollars each year. We are already feeling the 
economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic in Rhode Island, as I know 
our neighbors are in Massachusetts. If this amendment becomes law, it 
could compound the economic pain for our businesses, their workers, and 
our state.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong 
opposition to this amendment. This amendment would seek to ignore a 
U.S. Supreme Court federal standard and allow the Mashpee Wampanoag 
Tribe to open an off-reservation casino right on the border of Rhode 
Island.
  Under the Indian Reorganization Act, the U.S. Department of Interior 
is only allowed to take land into trust for tribes recognized before 
1934. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe became federally recognized in 2007. 
This amendment will set a dangerous precedent and undermine both a U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling and disregard the U.S. Department of Interior's 
most recent ruling.
  An off-reservation casino would result in an overwhelming economic 
loss to my state's economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a great 
blow to my state, hitting the travel and tourism industry particularly 
hard. Casinos in Rhode Island generated $300 million in annual revenue 
before closing due to the pandemic. An off-reservation casino would 
further devastate the financial loss to my state currently facing a 
12.4 percent unemployment rate in June, higher than the national 
average. We as a Congress should not be circumventing the court's 
decision and allow a one-time carve out for the building of a casino 
that is bad for Rhode Island. Regardless of this amendment, the Mashpee 
Tribe will still be a federally recognized tribe and will continue to 
receive federal benefits.
  Make no mistake, this amendment does not aim to help the Mashpee 
Wampanoag Tribe, but instead help lobbyists secure a win for their own 
interests. This amendment will do more than just greatly damage the 
Rhode Island economy, it will put Congress on a path of hand-picking 
winners and losers over the court's decision. This amendment would 
signal it's okay for lobbyists and hedge funds to be the decision 
makers in Congress, and not the representatives of the people. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in strongly opposing this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

           Amendment No. 102 Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
102 printed in House Report 116-459.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the 
desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 507, line 19, after the first dollar amount, insert 
     ``(reduced by $564,452,000)''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, waters of the U.S., social cost 
of carbon, the Clean Power Plan rules, these are just a few of the 
crushing regulations issued by the Obama-Biden Presidency.
  During the Obama-Biden administration, the EPA issued nearly 4,000 
regulations. These rules totaled tens of thousands of pages in Federal 
regulations and billions of dollars in compliance costs. The families, 
farmers, and

[[Page H3828]]

small businesses of Missouri could not keep up.
  Thankfully, since taking office, President Trump has kept his promise 
to deliver regulatory relief to the American people. He has removed 
seven regulations for every new one added, saving households thousands 
of dollars a year in regulatory costs.
  The other side would have you believe that reining in the EPA by 
reducing funding leads to dirtier air and dirtier water when, in fact, 
the opposite is the case. Under President Trump, emissions have fallen 
in every major category and overall have dropped 7 percent since 2017. 
Right now, we have the cleanest air since 1970. That is 50 years.
  Democrats want to take us back to Obama-Biden era spending policies 
with this funding bill, which breaks the recently agreed to spending 
caps and returns us to the regulatory machine of the prior 
administration that harms small businesses and family farmers. But the 
American people are not interested in returning to the increased costs 
and overregulation of that administration.
  My amendment simply reduces funding for the EPA to reflect President 
Trump's budget request.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, for 4 years in a row, President Trump 
has set up a truly--well, he sent us a budget that is just not workable 
when it comes to his budget request.
  On a bipartisan amendment, especially when it comes to the EPA, we 
have passed budgets at the end and sent them over to the EPA with more 
money than the President has requested. And why? Because we know we 
have to fight to have clean air, clean water. We need to have good 
scientists. We need to have researchers. We need to have people out 
doing inspections. We need to have our Environmental Protection Agency 
working.
  As I pointed out, the Congress has overwhelmingly rejected these 
requests for the President's cuts to the EPA. I predict we are going to 
see that happen again, for a fourth year in a row. That is because the 
EPA's environmental programs and management account does vital work, 
really important work protecting our air and drinking water, restoring 
our waterways, and safeguarding us from toxic chemicals.
  It has been reported worldwide, because of COVID, we all know people 
are driving less. We know that our factories, unfortunately, aren't 
running the way they should be, and a lot of people are out of work. 
So, yes, the air quality has improved because of the President's 
mishandling of the COVID emergency that we are facing. But we don't 
want to go back to those pollution levels. We want to work together in 
a bipartisan way.
  Another thing that the gentleman cuts are the geographic programs 
hugely popular in this Congress, and here, they are overwhelmingly 
supported bipartisanly--program work like the Great Lakes, Chesapeake 
Bay, Puget Sound, Long Island Sound, and the Florida estuaries. These 
programs would be devastated if we adopted the President's budget.
  Members on both sides of the aisle asked for robust funding in these 
accounts. Rural communities that rely upon technical assistance grants 
in this account, we help them to make sure that they can afford safe 
drinking water for their constituents and that they can safely manage 
their sewer and wastewater systems. We worked together to help rural 
communities.
  Consumers rely on the EPA's ENERGY STAR program to help them choose 
energy-efficient appliances, which save them money and help the 
environment. Madam Speaker, I can speak from personal experience, 
having sold appliances for many years, how important that ENERGY STAR 
was to someone when they were making a decision because they wanted to 
save money on their electric bill.
  Well, the Trump budget, the way it was presented to our subcommittee, 
would have slashed all these programs and much more, and the impacts to 
public health would be devastating.
  The American people overwhelmingly agree that we should be investing 
more to protect our families from pollution, not less.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, more money is not always the 
answer. The right policies, efficiency, is the answer.
  As I said earlier, for the first time in 50 years, under Trump's 
policies and Trump's spending, we have the cleanest air since 1970.
  I am not sure why the majority is concerned about cutting funding for 
the EPA when they have included $13 billion in additional emergency 
funding in this bill for the EPA alone.
  My amendment is not about preventing the EPA from doing its job. It 
is about ensuring that the EPA does the job we gave it to do and 
nothing else.
  Now is not the time to return to the spending habits and 
overregulation of the Obama-Biden era. If this funding amount is good 
enough for the President, it is good enough for me.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I am glad the gentleman brought up the 
$15 billion in the EPA's emergency spending budget.

  It is for wastewater treatment. That is for clean drinking water. 
That is for infrastructure. That is for jobs. That is so the next 
generation inherits clean water and a sewage waste disposal system that 
they don't find crumbling all around them because of neglect and 
because we have not lived up to our obligation to take care of those 
infrastructure investments.
  For 50 years, the EPA has been responsible for protecting health and 
the environment, and they have been doing a job in cleaning up the 
environment, as I mentioned with the restoration programs. The 
Chesapeake Bay, it is amazing what has happened, the Great Lakes.
  Congressman Joyce and I are constantly working with other Great Lakes 
representatives, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, who ask us 
to do even more in investing.
  These Trump administration budget cuts that the gentleman would have 
us return to would cripple the EPA's ability to accomplish those 
missions. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. Smith).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


           Amendment No. 103 Offered by Mr. Smith of Missouri

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
103 printed in House Report 116-459.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the 
desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 506, line 21, after the first dollar amount, insert 
     ``(reduced by $260,612,000)''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, once again, I rise to advocate 
in favor of the fiscal sanity of the Trump administration.
  Just like my last amendment, this amendment prevents the Democrats 
from taking us back to the Obama-Biden era policies of overregulation 
and overspending.
  The Obama-Biden EPA brought us thousands of new regulations, tens of 
thousands of new pages in the Federal

[[Page H3829]]

Register, and billions in compliance costs for American farmers, small 
businesses, and families, much of this backed by flawed research with a 
political agenda.
  The Office of Science and Technology aids in the regulatory process 
and is responsible for the faulty research that led to costly 
regulations like the social cost of carbon and the Clean Power Plan.
  The American people need transparent research without an agenda. They 
don't need Obama-Biden era regulations and spending policies.
  The amendment, once again, simply reduces funding for the EPA to 
reflect President Trump's budget request.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, as I said on the other amendment, for 4 
years in a row, President Trump has sent us truly appalling budget 
request numbers for the EPA, and the Congress has overwhelmingly 
rejected these requests on a bipartisan basis. As I said, I predict we 
will do that again for the fourth year in a row.
  The EPA's science and technology account does vital research on 
health effects of toxic chemicals and pollutants. Now, the Trump 
administration, by not doing this research and by not moving forward, 
protects corporate polluters' profits, not the health and safety of the 
American people. That is why, in my opinion, the administration's 
budget proposes to cut hundreds of millions of dollars for funding 
research on things like PFAS.
  Now, in my constituency, I have several major municipalities that can 
no longer just take the water out of the ground the way that they had 
before, send it to the homeowners, and they could turn on their tap and 
safely drink it. No, it has to be filtered for PFAS. We need research. 
We need standards on it.
  Lead. How many discussions have we had on this House floor? How many 
parents have we heard from? How many children have we heard from about 
the effects of lead in water?
  Mercury. I am from Minnesota. We have fish advisories because of 
mercury. Pregnant women have to be careful how much fish they consume. 
We have postings when we go to our lakes about how much fish we can 
consume. Mercury is a concern to many of us.
  And climate change. I am not afraid to talk about climate change. I 
was just on the phone with the Secretary of the Air Force, and we were 
talking about what we are going to have to spend in Alaska. You know, 
the permafrost is causing issues with radar installations not being 
stable--climate change. The permafrost, which is disappearing, is 
affecting the ability for runways and safe landings. Climate change.
  So, do we need to do the research on climate change? It is a national 
security issue. I am glad the EPA is out there looking at it, working 
with other agencies within the United States.
  People across this country overwhelmingly agree we should be 
investing more research in PFAS. We should be getting the lead out of 
our water. We should be understanding what is going on with mercury. We 
should also be addressing the effects of climate change and, most of 
all, protecting our families from pollution.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, if you listen to my Democrat 
colleagues, you would think the EPA could not go on without this 
funding that we are trying to reduce. It is about being efficient.
  This administration, as I had said earlier, under President Trump, 
emissions have fallen in every major category and overall have dropped 
7 percent since 2017. Right now, we have the cleanest air since 1970.
  Throwing money at an issue you care about is not the solution. Being 
efficient in government is the solution, and that is what the Trump EPA 
has done.

                              {time}  1930

  So they have asked for this particular amount of money, and I am 
making sure that we are giving the EPA what they need, not busting the 
spending caps which were agreed to by Republicans and Democrats by 
their current proposal.
  Let's keep the spending caps. Let's adopt my amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I will read from the National 
Geographic, published April 8, 2020:
  ``As the novel coronavirus tears around the world, it's exploiting 
our biggest weaknesses, from creaking health care systems to extreme 
social inequality. Its relationship with one pervasive and neglected 
problem, however, has been more tangled: Air pollution has intensified 
the pandemic. . . .''
  So we need to do studies on that, and the EPA works on that, but at 
the same time, the coronavirus has temporarily cleaned the skies.
  As I said earlier, for 50 years, the EPA has been responsible for 
protecting public health and the environment.
  We need to do research to understand how to protect public health and 
the environment; and more importantly than ever, we need to understand 
how to protect public health and the environment for people who have 
long been neglected, the people who are suffering the most right now, 
and that is the inequality, the injustice we are seeing between Black 
and Brown people in the United States.
  We need to do better with the EPA for addressing social injustices 
that have affected those populations most by living in polluted areas 
and being subjected to pollution. I want to work on that in Congress. 
The administration's cuts would cripple the EPA's ability to achieve 
that mission.
  Madam Speaker, if I understand correctly, the gentleman has yielded 
his time.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1060, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. Smith).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The amendment was rejected.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of H.R. 7608 is postponed.
