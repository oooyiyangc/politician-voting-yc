     on the contractor's or grantee's good-faith efforts and 
     progress towards compliance;
       (3) if the Secretary determines that a contractor or 
     grantee is not in compliance after the Secretary has granted

     determined are not applicable to non-State licensed 
     facilities.
       Sec. 230.  In addition to the existing Congressional 
     notification for formal site assessments of potential influx 
     facilities, the Secretary shall notify the Committees on 
     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
     at least 15 days before operationalizing an unlicensed 
     facility, and shall (1) specify whether the facility is hard-
     sided or soft-sided, and (2) provide analysis that indicates 
     that, in the absence of the influx facility, the likely 
     outcome is that unaccompanied alien children will remain in 
     the custody of the Department of Homeland Security for longer 
     than 72 hours or that unaccompanied alien children will be 
     otherwise placed in danger. Within 60 days of bringing such a

     for the purpose of maintaining custody of, or otherwise 
     housing, unaccompanied alien children (as defined in section 
     462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 
     279(g)(2))). Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
     require such a Senator or Member to provide prior notice of 
     the intent to enter such a facility for such purpose.
       Sec. 232.  Not later than 14 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, and monthly thereafter, the Secretary 
     shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the House 
     of Representatives and the Senate, and make publicly

     or not such separation was pursuant to an option selected by 
     the children, parents, or guardians), subsequently classified 
     as unaccompanied alien children, and transferred to the care 
     and custody of ORR during the previous month. Each report 
     shall contain the following information:
       (1) the number and ages of children so separated subsequent

     enforcement of the immigration laws (as defined in section

     1101(a)(17))).
       (b) Subsection (a) shall be construed to preclude the 
     transmission of information described in such subsection to 
     any individual, entity, or government agency with the 
     knowledge or intent that the information would be re-
     transmitted or otherwise shared for a purpose prohibited 
     under such subsection.
       (c) All records for which Office of Refugee Resettlement 
     policies require the written release authorization of the

     confidentiality and nondisclosure, including unaccompanied 
     alien child case files, specific information contained in

     such a child during clinical or therapeutic work, and other 
     confidential information pertaining to such children, their 
     sponsors, or their potential sponsors.
       (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit 
     or restrict the continued implementation of interagency 
     agreements or coordination under section 235 of the William 
     Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization 
     Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) pertinent to a child's placement

       Sec. 234.  To the extent practicable, and so long as it is 
     appropriate and in the best interest of the child, in cases 
     where the Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for 
     the care of siblings who are unaccompanied alien children as 
     defined in section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 
     2002 (6. U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), the Director of the Office shall 
     place the siblings--
       (1) in the same facility; or
       (2) with the same sponsor.

     the Council or Mayor of the District of Columbia from 
     addressing the issue of the provision of contraceptive 
     coverage by health insurance plans, but it is the intent of

     that the Secretary of the Interior may waive this prohibition

     Education, or more than one grade to expand the elementary 
     grade structure for Bureau-funded schools with a K-2 grade 
     structure on October 1, 1996. Appropriations made available

     are kept separate and apart from Bureau funds, and the Bureau 
     does not assume any obligation for charter school programs of 
     the State in which the school is located if the charter 
     school loses such funding. Employees of Bureau-funded schools 
     sharing a campus with a charter school and performing 
     functions related to the charter school's operation and 
     employees of a charter school shall not be treated as Federal 
     employees for purposes of chapter 171 of title 28, United 
     States Code.
       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including 
     section 113 of title I of appendix C of Public Law 106-113, 
     if in fiscal year 2003 or 2004 a grantee received indirect 
     and administrative costs pursuant to a distribution formula 
     based on section 5(f) of Public Law 101-301, the Secretary 
     shall continue to distribute indirect and administrative cost 
     funds to such grantee using the section 5(f) distribution 
     formula.
       Funds available under this Act may not be used to establish 
     satellite locations of schools in the Bureau school system as 
     of September 1, 1996, except that the Secretary may waive 
     this prohibition in order for an Indian tribe to provide 
     language and cultural immersion educational programs for non-
     public schools located within the jurisdictional area of the 
     tribal government which exclusively serve tribal members, do 
     not include grades beyond those currently served at the 
     existing Bureau-funded school, provide an educational 
     environment with educator presence and academic facilities 
     comparable to the Bureau-funded school, comply with all 
     applicable Tribal, Federal, or State health and safety 
     standards, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and 
     demonstrate the benefits of establishing operations at a 
     satellite location in lieu of incurring extraordinary costs, 
     such as for transportation or other impacts to students such 
     as those caused by busing students extended distances:  
     Provided, That no funds available under this Act may be used 
     to fund operations, maintenance, rehabilitation, 
     construction, or other facilities-related costs for such 
     assets that are not owned by the Bureau:  Provided further, 
     That the term ``satellite school'' means a school location 
     physically separated from the existing Bureau school by more 
     than 50 miles but that forms part of the existing school in 
     all other respects.
       Funds made available for Tribal Priority Allocations within 
     Operation of Indian Programs and Operation of Indian 
     Education Programs may be used to execute requested 
     adjustments in tribal priority allocations initiated by an 
     Indian Tribe.

     project or projects meet the standards under subsection (c).

     nonviable, or be reasonably expected to become economically

     determination that such a waiver is necessary to facilitate 
     the financing of acquisition, construction, and/or 
     rehabilitation of the receiving project or projects.

     subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving

     the local government that such a multifamily property owned 
     or having a mortgage held by the Secretary is not feasible

     rehabilitating and operating the property and all available 
     Federal, State, and local resources, including rent 
     adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted 
     Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (in this section

     of that property, contract for project-based rental 
     assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing 
     housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. The 
     Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that 
     project-based contracts remain in effect prior to 
     foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual abatement 
     remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major 
     threats to health and safety after written notice to and 
     informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other 
     available remedies, such as partial abatements or 
     receivership. After disposition of any multifamily property 
     described in this section, the contract and allowable rent 
     levels on such properties shall be subject to the 
     requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.
       Sec. 213.  Public housing agencies that own and operate 400 
     or fewer public housing units may elect to be exempt from any 
     asset management requirement imposed by the Secretary in

     capital provided by a third-party that requires time to 
     effectuate; or
       (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies 
     available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the 
     Secretary.
       (d) The Secretary shall take appropriate steps to ensure 
     that project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the 
     exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist 
     relocation of tenants for major threats to health and safety 
     after written notice to the affected tenants. To the extent 
     the Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants 
     and the local government, that the property is not feasible

     management and occupancy review within the past 36 months. 
     The report shall include--
       (1) identification of the enforcement actions being taken 
     to address such conditions, including imposition of civil 
     money penalties and termination of subsidies, and 
     identification of properties that have such conditions 
     multiple times;
       (2) identification of actions that the Department of 
     Housing and Urban Development is taking to protect tenants of 
     such identified properties; and

     further improve the living conditions at properties covered 
     under a housing assistance payment contract.

member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective

from Texas (Ms. Granger) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.


                             General Leave

  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. Though, to consume time is not what I am here to do today. To 
consume time is a luxury that we can no longer afford.
  Madam Speaker, after decades of disinvestment and the devastation of 
the pandemic, the time is now to reinvest in the American people. The 
time is now to create jobs, grow opportunity, and support our Nation's 
most vulnerable. The time is now to meet the moral test of government.
  Vice President Hubert Humphrey defined this test by how government 
treats ``those who are in the dawn of life . . . , those who are in the 
twilight of life . . . , and those who are in the shadows of life.''
  As I have led the Committee on Appropriations over the past 6 months, 
this idea has served as a guiding light. It has challenged us to dig 
deeply into the areas of greatest need and to provide every American 
the opportunity to contribute and succeed.
  I believe the package of seven appropriations bills before us, H.R. 
4502, will not only pass this moral test, it will fulfill the sacred 
mission we are charged with as a body to leave this Nation stronger and 
better than we found it.
  With investments in education, nutrition assistance, and rural and 
underserved communities, we are providing every American the resources 
they need. By rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure and confronting 
the climate crisis, we are creating and sustaining good-paying American 
jobs. And with renewed urgency to protect our democracy, close racial 
disparities, and advance women's rights, we are building back better 
and fostering a brighter future. We are meeting the moment and more 
than meeting Hubert Humphrey's moral test.
  As chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee, I want to take a moment to turn to the 
investments we are making in this legislation more specifically to lift 
up the most vulnerable and prepare our Nation for future challenges.
  The $253.8 billion we provide in the Labor-HHS bill represents a 
historic increase of 28 percent. It includes $7.4 billion for the Child 
Care and Development Block Grant, $12.2 billion for Head Start, nearly 
a $20 billion increase in Federal support for high-poverty schools, and 
record funding for students with disabilities.
  It provides continued support for social and emotional learning and 
makes post-secondary education more affordable with a $400 increase for 
the maximum Pell grant. It includes $1.1 billion for programs serving 
historically Black colleges and universities, minority-serving 
institutions, community colleges, and underresourced institutions of 
higher education. And it provides $100 million for the Strengthening 
Community Colleges Training Grant program.

[[Page H4047]]

  To give workers the skills and protections they need, this bill 
includes an increase of $1.6 billion for the Employment and Training 
Administration, including a total of $285 million for registered 
apprenticeships and $3.1 billion for Workforce Innovation and 
Opportunity Act State grants, and $2.1 billion for worker protection 
agencies.
  This bill heeds the lessons of the pandemic by providing record 
funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including 
$1 billion for public health infrastructure and capacity. It invests 
$6.5 billion in the National Institutes of Health, which were crucial 
in developing the COVID-19 vaccine in record time, including an 
increase of $3.5 billion for biomedical research at existing NIH 
institutes and centers. And it supports the President's request to 
establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H, 
which will be indispensable in achieving breakthroughs in the treatment 
of diseases, such as diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer, 
and Alzheimer's disease.
  This bill further provides $100 million to help communities create a 
new mental health crisis response partnership pilot program in 
partnership with our law enforcement agencies. And it provides $50 
million for gun violence prevention research at the NIH and the CDC.
  Finally, this bill ensures equal treatment for women by repealing the 
discriminatory Hyde amendment and supports the more than 3 million men, 
women, and young adults who receive the full range of family planning 
and reproductive health services funded by Title X.
  I have just scratched the surface of the historic and unprecedented 
investments contained in this funding package, which together meet this 
moment and, I believe, faithfully fulfill the moral test of government.
  I thank all the subcommittee chairs, the ranking members, and all the 
members of the Committee on Appropriations and their staffs for their 
hard work on these bills.
  In particular, I must note my deep appreciation for my partnership 
with Ranking Member Cole; my partnership with the ranking member of the 
full committee, Congresswoman Granger; and my gratitude for the Labor-
HHS staff led by Stephen Steigleder, and including Jared Bass, Philip 
Tizzani, Jennifer Cama, Jackie Kilroy, Laurie Mignone, Becky Salay, and 
Trisha Castaneda. Thank you as well to the minority staff, Susan Ross 
and Kathryn Salmon. Last but not least, I must thank my personal staff, 
including Liz Albertine, Christian Lovell, Caitlin Peruccio, and Marie 
Gualtieri.

  Madam Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume 
and rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4502, a package of seven 
fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills that will be considered this 
week.
  I wish the circumstances were different and I could support this 
important piece of legislation that funds critical programs. 
Unfortunately, after months of committee hearings and markups, this 
year's bills have too many fatal flaws.
  First, there is no agreement between Republicans and Democrats on the 
top-line spending level for appropriations.
  Second, there is no bipartisan agreement on the funding level for 
each individual bill. To put it simply, nondefense spending is too high 
and defense spending is too low.
  Third, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have included 
the most alarming policy changes I have ever seen.
  While acknowledging the hard work of Chair DeLauro and her 
subcommittee chairs, this package does not reflect the type of 
bipartisan agreement that we must have to complete the appropriations 
process this year. Instead of crafting legislation both sides of the 
aisle can support, the bills included in the package were written to 
address the most extreme views in the majority party.
  At a time of record-high deficits and debt, now is not the time to 
double down on increasing domestic spending.
  Here are just a few examples of the excess spending included in this 
package: a 36 percent increase for the Labor-HHS bill; a 39 percent 
increase for the White House; and a 22 percent increase for the Vice 
President's office.
  All of this comes at a time when we are seeing inflation rise at the 
fastest pace in 13 years. For the sake of generations to come, we can't 
afford to spend like this.
  In addition to these unrealistic spending levels, the majority has 
made questionable policy decisions that will complicate any attempts to 
come to a bipartisan agreement. For example, their funding priorities 
will reverse the gains in energy independence that we have made over 
the past decade and will actually increase our dependence on China for 
critical minerals.
  Another area that is particularly concerning is that this bill fails 
to include longstanding language prohibiting the transfer of detainees 
currently at Guantanamo Bay to the United States. These detainees are 
the worst of the worst, and we need assurance that they will not be 
moved to our soil.
  Finally, the most startling position taken in this bill is the 
deliberate removal of the Hyde amendment and other longstanding 
bipartisan provisions to protect life. The bill also provides funds for 
the largest Planned Parenthood affiliate in the country, which performs 
thousands of abortions each year.
  This is not the way to do business if we want to enact full-year 
appropriations bills this year. With the House only planning to be in 
session and voting for 12 more legislative days before the end of the 
fiscal year, we have a lot of work to do and little time to do it. We 
must develop top-line spending levels that both sides can support.
  We have countless policy differences that will take time to resolve, 
and protecting the lives of unborn children must be the first step.
  If we want to avoid a long-term continuing resolution--or worse, a 
government shutdown--we must get serious and do the work our 
constituents sent us here to do.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this package, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chair of the Committee on Appropriations' 
Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I thank Chair DeLauro for yielding, and I 
thank her for her leadership of this really great and historic 
committee.
  The Energy and Water division makes significant investments to secure 
the imperative of U.S. energy independence in perpetuity to foster 
world-class scientific innovation and address the crisis of climate 
change. Not only does our bill meet the needs of the current moment, it 
provides a firmer foundation to build back better.
  Headlines tell a clear story. NBC News reported: ``The West catches 
fire while the East goes underwater as climate change fuels both 
extremes.'' As these extreme conditions spread across our country, our 
goal must be to provide the necessary energy and water assets to help 
sustain life on our corner of Mother Earth.
  Our bill invests over $53 billion to provide strategic resources to 
address these challenges while creating good-paying, middle-class jobs 
in communities across this country, with a greater commitment to those 
too often left behind.

                              {time}  1530

  Let me walk through key investments in this bill.
  Madam Speaker, $45.1 billion is for the Department of Energy, $3.2 
billion above enacted. Within the Department of Energy, the Office of 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy--so much a part of our future--
receives record funding of $3.7 billion, $906 million above enacted.
  In the weatherization programs, they received $398 million, $83 
million above enacted. That means thousands more homes retrofitted. 
ARPA-E receives $600 million, $173 million above enacted. The Office of 
Science--world-class science--receives $7.32 billion, $294 million 
above enacted. We responsibly fund our nuclear deterrent and increase 
funding for nonproliferation programs.
  The Army Corps receives $8.6 billion, $1.9 billion above the budget 
request, to support our Nation's water infrastructure and dredge ports 
and harbors.

[[Page H4048]]

  The Bureau of Reclamation receives $1.9 billion, $413 million above 
the budget request, including $191 million to address the western 
drought.
  Our bill increases funding for regional commissions which promote 
economic development in distressed communities.
  In short, this bill meets our responsibility to sustain life on Earth 
by providing critical funding for water infrastructure, clean energy, 
the highest level of scientific innovation, and a credible nuclear 
deterrent while supporting the creation of good paying jobs in every 
region of our country.
  I also wish to, in closing, thank my dear staff for their very hard 
work beginning with Jaime Shimek, our chief clerk; Angie Giancarlo, 
serving the ranking member and the Republican side of the aisle; Mike 
Brain; Scott McKee; Brian Smith; Will Ostertag; Lauren Leuck; and, 
finally, Matt Kaplan of my own staff who will be going on to work with 
the National Resources Defense Council, and we will miss him so very 
much.
  Ms. DeLAURO. I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Idaho (Mr. Simpson), who is the ranking member of the Energy and Water 
Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
time.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to H.R. 4502, the 
seven-bill fiscal year 2022 appropriations package that includes the 
Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. I had hoped to be 
able to support the appropriations bill this year. Unfortunately, the 
overall funding framework for these bills lacks bipartisan support. The 
House framework includes massive increases for non-defense programs and 
shortchanges our national security needs.
  Taken in isolation, there are many things in the Energy and Water 
bill that House Republicans could support. For example, strong support 
for the Corps of Engineers, including specific community project 
funding and additional programmatic funding, is a bipartisan priority.
  Of great importance to me, of course, is the Department of Energy's 
nuclear energy program. I appreciate Chairwoman Kaptur's efforts to 
address many of my priorities within this account.
  In particular, I am pleased to see increased funding to continue 
three demonstration projects under the Advanced Small Modular Reactor 
and Advanced Reactors Demonstration programs, as well as continued work 
on microreactors, including the MARVEL program.
  Also notable is the support for ensuring a supply of high-assay, low-
enriched uranium, or HALEU, that will be the fuel that will be used by 
many of the next generation of reactors. The Department of Energy will 
serve as an essential, temporary source of HALEU until the commercial 
market can be established.
  While I support the focus on demonstrating new technologies, I am 
disappointed to see that the bill does not also continue support for 
the Versatile Test Reactor. The VTR will be a valuable domestic testing 
facility for many advanced technologies. Continuing work now, even if 
at a slower pace than was originally planned, will allow us to benefit 
from collaboration with one of the demonstration projects.
  I was pleased to join Congressman Weber in offering an amendment to 
highlight the importance of the VTR, and I urge the full House to adopt 
it. I look forward to working with my colleagues to support progress on 
the VTR as soon as possible.
  Unfortunately, the bill before us underfunds our national security 
needs. An increase of less than 1 percent for weapons activities does 
not even keep up with inflation. And while the budget request was 
itself insufficient, the bill before us does not even meet the budget 
request for certain stockpile sustainment and major modification 
programs. We must uphold our Nation's strong national deterrence 
posture, and to do that we must adequately fund the activities 
necessary to maintain a safe, reliable, and effective stockpile.
  In closing, I would like to thank Chairwoman Kaptur for putting 
together this year's Energy and Water bill in her typical cooperative 
style. It is clear that she and the majority staff worked hard to 
address individual Members' priorities from both sides of the aisle, 
and I thank her for that consideration.
  I would also like to thank Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member 
Granger of the full committee for their leadership and support of the 
important programs in this bill.
  I look forward to working together as the bill moves through the 
legislative process to develop a final Energy and Water bill that 
reflects a balanced set of priorities that can be supported by Members 
on both sides of the aisle.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Price), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related 
Agencies.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this critical legislation. I want to start by thanking my partner, 
Ranking Member Mario Diaz-Balart, for his collaboration and his 
cooperation, which have made this a better bill reflecting many 
bipartisan priorities which we can proudly support.
  Division G, the T-HUD section, represents a renewed commitment to the 
upgrading of our aging transportation infrastructure, addressing our 
Nation's affordable housing and homelessness crises, bolstering our 
resiliency to natural disasters and climate change, remedying 
inequities and disparities in our housing and transportation systems, 
and promoting safety--whether it be preventing carbon monoxide 
poisoning in public housing or improving the certification of 
complicated aircraft to improve aviation safety.
  Overall, the bill includes $84.1 billion in discretionary funding. 
That is an increase of nearly $8.7 billion over the fiscal year 2021 
enacted level.
  The bill also includes major increases in contract authority for 
formula grant programs that draw on the highway trust fund rather than 
discretionary funding, and in that respect, of course, we are mirroring 
the INVEST in America Act recently passed by this body.
  On the housing side of the ledger, we are preventing the evictions of 
more than 4.8 million households by fully renewing all housing choice 
vouchers and meeting the renewal needs of several other programs. This 
is coupled with critical new investments, including more than 125,000 
new tenant-based vouchers for low-income families and people 
experiencing or at risk of homelessness, and over 4,000 new affordable 
housing units for seniors and people with disabilities.
  The bill increases the public housing fund by 11 percent to preserve 
nearly 1 million units of affordable housing and improve the living 
conditions for more than 2 million individuals served by our public 
housing programs. The bill also includes significant increases for 
Community Development Block Grants, the HOME Program, and NeighborWorks 
to help expand affordable housing, spur community revitalization, and 
generate jobs and economic activity.
  Our bill, Madam Speaker, does right by transportation as well. All 
modes receive robust funding, including highways, transit, rail, 
aviation, bike and pedestrian projects, and ports. This bill nearly 
doubles our investments in passenger and freight rail. It expands port 
infrastructure programs by about one-third and emphasizes safety at the 
Federal Aviation Administration. The bill includes the necessary 
resources to ensure all projects in the Federal Transit 
Administration's Capital Investment Grants pipeline--New Starts and 
Small Starts--can move forward in 2022 and provides $1.2 billion for 
the oversubscribed RAISE program.
  Madam Speaker, we are proud of this bill, and we urge our colleagues 
to support it with confidence.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Womack), who is the ranking member of the Financial 
Services and General Government Subcommittee.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, my thanks to the ranking member for the 
time.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this package of appropriations 
bills.

[[Page H4049]]

  As the ranking member of the Appropriations Financial Services and 
General Government Subcommittee, I have great respect for my colleague, 
Chairman   Mike Quigley. We work well together, and that is saying 
something because he is a Cubs fan, and I am a Cardinal fan.
  The bill we are debating today, Madam Speaker, is packed with 
unjustifiable spending and ignores our unsustainable fiscal trajectory.
  In light of unprecedented pandemic spending, it was my hope that this 
fiscal year we would prioritize making the tough choices necessary to 
chart a responsible fiscal path forward. Instead, the Financial 
Services division of the bill proposes a 20 percent increase in 
discretionary spending over fiscal year 2021 and numerous agencies 
funded receive a double-digit percentage increase over last year.
  Those numbers are unconscionable, Madam Speaker, when you consider 
the fact that this country is well over $28 trillion in debt.
  I noted with interest the comments of the overall chairwoman when she 
talked about the moral test of government. Madam Speaker, to me the 
moral test of government is for us to do our work and to take care of 
the urgent needs of our country, but not burden future generations in 
the course of doing so.
  Furthermore, my colleagues on the other side continue to call for 
trillions in new government spending, and a new GAO report came out 
just recently that says more than $1 trillion of the spending that we 
have commissioned through the coronavirus phenomenon remains unspent. 
Not just that, this spending has created an inflationary spiral that is 
affecting every taxpayer budget in my district.
  There are also several controversial policy changes included in the 
FSGG division, such as allowing D.C. tax dollars to fund abortions and 
removing the prohibition on Federal employee health benefits funding 
for abortions. These policy changes are no-goes and make this bill and 
minibus, as a whole, dead in the water.
  Again, I oppose this package of appropriations, including the 
Financial Services division due to the radical increases in spending 
and these partisan policies.
  But, Madam Speaker, I do look forward to working across the aisle 
with both my counterparts in the House and in the Senate to come up 
with a bill and a compromise that will actually work for America.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Bishop), who is the chairman of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies.
  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding.
  I rise in support of H.R. 4502. As chair of the Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee, I am pleased to highlight the national priorities that 
are funded in our division.
  First, I would like to thank our distinguished ranking member, Mr. 
Fortenberry, and the entire subcommittee for their continued bipartisan 
cooperation.
  The jurisdiction of our bill is far-reaching and touches the lives of 
every citizen, and while we may disagree on matters of policy from time 
to time, agriculture, rural development, the safety of our food and 
drugs, and the livability and sustainability of our ecosystems here and 
across the globe are indeed bipartisan concerns, and we truly approach 
our work collaboratively to achieve the greater good for our country 
and humanity.
  However, our FY22 allocation is $26.55 billion, which is $2.85 
billion over the fiscal year 2021.
  The bill addresses three key priorities:
  First, it ensures equitable participation in USDA programs.
  Second, it addresses the impacts of climate change.
  Third, it reinvests in staff and leadership offices at USDA.
  The bill provides $4.7 billion for rural development initiatives, 
including more than $900 million for broadband expansion to provide 
economic development opportunities and improved education and 
healthcare services in rural communities. The bill continues important 
funding for the Community Facilities Program that supports everything 
from libraries and fire stations to childcare centers and nursing 
homes.
  The bill provides $2.9 billion in farm and conservation programs, 
$3.4 billion for agricultural research including a significant increase 
for the 1890 land-grant institutions, $1.74 billion for Food for Peace 
grants, and $245 million for the McGovern-Dole program, both in support 
of our diplomacy.
  Food insecurity continues to hurt millions of Americans. Our bill 
fully funds the SNAP, WIC, and child nutrition programs and helps 
increase access to healthy, nutritious food.
  The Food and Drug Administration is funded at $3.47 billion in 
discretionary funding, with increases that help combat the opioid 
crisis, rare cancers, foodborne outbreaks, and heavy metals in baby 
food.
  Madam Speaker, I want to thank my personal staff, Michael Reed, 
Tynesha Boomer, and Danny Giddings; and the subcommittee staff, Martha 
Foley, Diem-Linh Jones, Perry Yates, Joe Layman, Randy Staples, Justin 
Masucci, and Echo Domingues for their hard work on the bill.
  Also, I would like to thank Tom O'Brien from the minority staff. And, 
of course, I thank Chair DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger for their 
tremendous leadership.

                              {time}  1545

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).
  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to give a special shout 
out to Michael Reed, who is retiring as my chief of staff and senior 
policy advisor for appropriations after 18 years of extraordinary 
service. We thank him mightily for his service, for his monumental 
contributions to Georgia's Second District, and we wish him well as he 
enters the next chapter of his life.
  I am proud of this division and the entire bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it. It is a good bill. It is good for America.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the vice ranking member of the full Committee on 
Appropriations, and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, 
Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.
  Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I will be brief. But I want to begin by 
thanking Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger for their help 
throughout the process.
  However, despite many areas of agreement in the bill before us today, 
particularly relating to Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, I 
will oppose the bill.
  Madam Speaker, at the end of May, President Biden sent us a $6 
trillion budget request for fiscal year 2022. The bill presented today, 
in many ways, mirrors that budget request. Proposing the highest 
spending level since World War II, the price tag alone is utterly 
unrealistic. As we continue the see inflation on the rise, such a 
proposal is bad for the recovering economy as well.
  Instead of focusing on the urgent priorities for all Americans, like 
reopening our economy and schools, President Biden's budget request and 
this bill, elevate controversial left-wing policies over-pressing 
needs, like strengthening our national defense and addressing the 
crisis at our southern border.
  In fact, this budget calls for billions of dollars to fund 
progressive priorities and policies like the Green New Deal, while 
recommending an effective cut in the funding for our military. With 
China and Russia growing their militaries by the day, this is a very 
misguided approach.
  Finally, most egregious in the President's budget and the current 
deal, which is reflected here, is the removal of the Hyde amendment, 
which protects life and prevents Federal taxpayer-funded abortions. 
Since it was first enacted in 1976, it is estimated this provision has 
saved more than 2 million lives while protecting the conscience rights 
of the great majority of Americans who are opposed to publicly-funded 
abortions. Also, it removes the Weldon amendment, which provides 
important conscience protection for our healthcare providers who object 
to participating in abortion proceedings.
  This amendment and the Weldon amendment have both been supported

[[Page H4050]]

for generations by Republicans and Democrats alike.
  Madam Speaker, you know that the Democrats in Congress do not have 
the majorities capable of passing this bill without Republican vote. In 
the days and weeks ahead, it is my hope that Members on both sides of 
the aisle and both Chambers can negotiate spending that is reasonable 
and will not lead us to financial disaster.
  But the first step toward negotiation will be the full reinstatement 
of the Hyde and Weldon amendments along with similar pro-life 
protections contained across the 12 spending bills that we consider as 
a committee.
  These protections need to be reinstated for this package to move to 
the President's desk. Quite frankly, everyone in the Chamber knows this 
bill will never pass the United States Senate without their inclusion, 
and the majority of American people support that view.
  In closing, Madam Speaker, while the bill does fund many good things, 
and while I certainly appreciate the openness of the process in which 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut and the gentlewoman from Texas have 
participated in developing the bill, I do oppose it as drafted.
  The price tag is too high. The bill contains too many poison pill 
policy riders, and it funds too many unauthorized programs, and bows to 
a leftist agenda that does not reflect the views and values of the 
American people.
  Madam Speaker, I remain hopeful that we can do better, and I urge 
rejection of the bill.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Subcommittee on 
Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies for 
Appropriations.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam Speaker, I thank Chair DeLauro for her 
leadership during this process and for yielding.
  The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
division of the bill highlights our continued commitment to our 
servicemembers and to their families and to our veterans.
  Constructing the barracks, bases, and training facilities that our 
military needs is crucial to our country's military readiness. Properly 
funding the Department of Veterans Affairs is how we deliver on the 
promise of medical care and other benefits that our veterans have 
earned through service to our Nation.
  The Related Agencies, including the American Battle Monuments 
Commission and Arlington National Cemetery, demonstrate how we honor 
the sacrifices of those who served. That is why I am proud that that 
bill contains $124.5 billion in discretionary funding, an $11.4 billion 
increase above the enacted funding level, and $1.3 billion above the 
President's budget request.
  For Military Construction, we provide $10.9 billion for critical 
infrastructure on military installations, including for seven new child 
development centers, and to address issues such as mold, vermin, and 
lead in military family housing.

  The bill also invests in climate change and energy resilience at our 
military bases and provides $150 million for PFAS cleanup at 
contaminated installations.
  For VA, this bill provides $113.1 billion in discretionary funding, 
including $97.6 billion for medical care that makes record investments 
in women's health along with the ``whole health'' model, mental health 
and suicide prevention, homelessness assistance, rural health, and 
opioid abuse prevention.
  The bill significantly boosts funding for VA research to support work 
studying areas like toxic exposures and traumatic brain injury, and 
infrastructure improvements to ensure modern, safe facilities to treat 
our veterans, as well as continued implementation of Electronic Health 
Record Modernization and efforts to reduce the disability claims 
backlog.
  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member Judge Carter and 
Ranking Member Granger, I am proud to have you as my partners and 
friends. I would like to thank the staff of both subcommittees and our 
personal offices.
  This is a good bill and does right by our servicemembers, their 
families, and our veterans. It also benefits Floridians and advances 
our Democratic priorities.
  The Labor-Health bill includes $6 million, an increase of $1 million 
for the EARLY Act legislation that I authored that educates young and 
at-risk women about breast cancer. It also includes language to 
implement my PALS Act to extend breast cancer screening for women 40 to 
49 without co-pay until January 2025.
  The Agriculture bill includes important report language and funding 
for response to citrus greening disease, as well as language and 
funding to strengthen the regulation of e-cigarettes.
  The Energy and Water bill includes a record increase for climate-
conscious clean energy programs, and a record $350 million for 
Everglades restoration. This is $100 million over the enacted level, 
but I know we can do more.
  The Financial Services bill also includes $2 million, an increase of 
$700,000 for the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act program, 
which I authored to prevent childhood drownings.
  Additionally, the Interior-Environment bill includes language that 
orders a full environmental review on oil drilling applications in Big 
Cypress National Preserve, and further blocks offshore oil or gas 
drilling in new coastal areas.
  The Transportation-Housing bill includes $300 million for the Port 
Infrastructure Development Program, a $70 million increase, which will 
help Florida's ports recover from COVID-19.
  And, finally, this package includes many of my community funding 
projects. I am proud to support this package.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Carter), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I really wish I was here 
expressing my support for the fiscal year 2022 Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill, because it includes 
funding for many important construction projects and programs for 
veterans. But, unfortunately, I cannot support the bill for three 
reasons.
  The responsibility of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies is to provide adequate resources 
for our servicemembers, ensure that we fulfill the promises America 
made to our veterans, and be good stewards of tax dollars.
  While this bill includes funding for many priorities, including child 
development centers, barracks, suicide prevention programs, and 
electronic health records, it is not part of a bipartisan funding 
framework that appropriately allocates funding between defense and 
nondefense programs.
  The bill also drops two restrictions on funding that have protected 
Americans from the transfer of detainees, terrorists, to the United 
States for more than 10 years. There is no reason to allow these 
terrorists on U.S. soil. They need to remain in Guantanamo Bay and pay 
for their heinous crimes.
  Finally, I oppose the majority party's attempt to force hardworking 
citizens to pay to end unborn human life. The Hyde amendment protects 
every American from seeing their tax dollars used to fund something 
that is the exact opposite of the American value of life, liberty, and 
pursuit of happiness.
  It is simple. Congress must maintain the Hyde amendment.
  Despite my concerns, I think we can resolve our differences, address 
these issues, and provide responsible levels of funding for the next 
fiscal year.
  In closing, I want to thank Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz for her work 
on this bill and stewardship of the Subcommittee on Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Along with the 
staff, she has personally worked to address many requests from all 
Members in this bill.
  Also, I thank Ranking Member Granger and Chairwoman DeLauro for their 
support.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House.

[[Page H4051]]

  

  Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as everybody knows, I had the delightful 
opportunity of serving on the Appropriations Committee as an active 
member for 23 years. I am on leave, and I may be on leave forever, who 
knows, but I care a lot about these bills. These are the only bills 
that have to pass. They are the only bills that if they don't pass, the 
government shuts down.
  They are the bills that used to bring us together. It is relatively 
easy to compromise on figures, but it is difficult to compromise on 
other issues. Although, I will say, as I begin my remarks--and I am not 
going to be that long, but as I begin my remarks, I voted for, in the 
1980s and 1990s and over the last 20 years, for appropriations bills in 
which there were contained issues that I severely disagreed with, and I 
know Ms. DeLauro has as well.

  But I know that overall we had to pass the bills, and that I thought 
then, and I think now, that the bills were largely dealing with what 
the American people wanted us to deal with.
  So I rise today, Madam Speaker, in support of these bills, the seven 
in this package, and hopefully, three to come, and the two thereafter, 
whenever we bring them to the floor.
  Last Congress, after Democrats took control of the House majority, we 
passed legislation to fund nearly all of government before the end of 
the summer. I was very proud of that. We passed it in June of 2019, and 
we passed it in July of 2020. We have done that 2 years in a row now. 
What we haven't accomplished, however, is the passage of these bills 
prior to September 30. That is what we should be doing.
  I know the chair feels that way, and I think the ranking member feels 
that way. I haven't talked to her specifically about that, but I think 
she does.
  Moving the appropriations process along on time made it easier to 
forestall shutdowns and fund the government for the American people.
  Now we are doing so again and with a Democratic-controlled Senate and 
White House, we are passing bills of which every Member of this body 
can be proud. And I predict that every Member of this body will go home 
and claim credit for something in these appropriations bills, whether 
you voted for or against.
  The appropriations bills we are bringing to the floor in this minibus 
package deliver for all of our constituents. They invest in economic 
growth; they expand infrastructure; they care for our veterans; they 
make college more affordable; advance research into combatting the next 
pandemic and curing rare diseases; protect America's public lands and 
keeping our air and water clean.

                              {time}  1600

  They help farmers, small business, and large business. They help 
farmers and invest in rural communities, and combat hunger and provide 
housing, among other things.
  These investments in the American people will help us build back 
better from the pandemic and enable our businesses, workers, students, 
and farmers to get ahead in the global economy.
  One of the provisions I want to highlight in particular, of which I 
am very proud, is the major increase in funding for full-service 
community schools. I have been proud to advocate for this program since 
we first launched it in 2008.
  Full-service community schools help the youngest Americans and their 
families--that is the key, ``and their families,'' the whole family. 
Critical services are accessible all in one place, not only early 
childhood education but also nutrition assistance, dental exams, 
financial literacy courses, and more.
  When children and their families have easy access to these resources, 
it means greater success for students throughout their later years in 
school, better preparing them for college and careers and helping us 
close the achievement gap.
  In my State of Maryland, we have had tremendous success with our 
network of Judy Centers. Judy Centers are named after Judith P. Hoyer, 
my wife, and in her memory. She was an early childhood educator in 
Prince George's County and a pioneer in the development of this type of 
program.
  Like full-service community schools, Judy Centers are proving their 
worth by narrowing achievement gaps and preparing more and more 
students for success in kindergarten and later grades.
  The minibus on the floor today would invest $443 million for this 
critical initiative. Now, that is not a lot per child, but it is a lot 
of effect per child, which will help States launch and expand their 
full-service community school programs and serve many more children and 
their families.
  I thank Chairwoman DeLauro, not only for her strong support and her 
leadership in making sure that funding was included, but also for her 
leadership of this committee. She has been a very faithful steward, and 
a steward who has acted in a very transparent, inclusive way so that 
every Member knew what they could have and honor their initiatives and 
their priorities.
  All the members and staff of the Appropriations Committee for their 
hard work should be thanked as well by all of us. These are tough bills 
to put together, tough bills to move forward. I thank them for their 
efforts together to ensure that the House is doing its job for the 
people.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this package of 
appropriations bills.
  Now, some may say, ``Well, the Senate hasn't acted,'' and that is a 
lamentable fact. The Senate has not passed a single appropriations bill 
out of committee, nor had they passed a single bill out of committee by 
the end of the fiscal year last year.
  I would hope that our colleagues in the United States Senate would 
not keep treating the appropriations process as a backwater because 
where we put our money is where our heart is, where our priorities are. 
This bill, these bills--this bill, but these bills, all 10 of the ones 
that we are going to consider hopefully this week--show where our 
priorities are.
  I hope that the Senate will begin its own appropriations process so 
that we can complete our work together, perhaps not before the end of 
the fiscal year but certainly before the end of the year, so we do not 
have some either CR or omnibus, which is the product of just a few as 
opposed to the many in this House and in the Senate.
  I urge support of this minibus. I urge support of the three bills to 
come, the State-Foreign Operations bill, the Commerce-Justice bill, and 
the Legislative Branch bill. I thank all the cardinals and the ranking 
members for their help and their work.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the ranking member of the Transportation and 
Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4502.
  I would first like to thank Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member 
Granger. While we have, obviously, disagreements at this stage of the 
game, that cannot stop us from working on behalf of the American 
people.
  I also particularly want to thank Chairman Price for his friendship, 
for his openness and transparency, and for his integrity. He is 
committed to transparency, which is something that we should all expect 
from the agencies that we fund.
  This bill includes funding and language requests from Members on both 
sides of the aisle. That was not a small task, but it keeps the best 
ideas coming forward to improve the way that, again, our government 
functions, and that is important.
  I am pleased that the bill continues investments in our Nation's 
highways, rails, transit, and airport infrastructure, as well as we 
continue to make progress improving port infrastructure, which, 
obviously, is key for our supply chains.
  The chairman once again also has made DOT safety programs a priority. 
Our roads, railways, and skies are safer due to our shared priority on 
safety.
  Chairman Price's commitment to addressing homelessness and housing 
for the elderly and the disabled is evident in this bill. We share the 
goal of promoting affordable housing and providing a safety net to our 
most valuable citizens.
  Now, again, while I support and applaud many of the decisions made in 
this bill, a $9 billion top-line increase, a 13 percent increase over 
last year, is just something that I cannot support.
  Let me give you an example. I am concerned about the dramatic 
expansion of HUD assistance programs in

[[Page H4052]]

this bill--well-meaning, but, in part, the problem is that those 
increases would need to be sustained in future years. This would crowd 
out our ability to make targeted, responsible transportation and 
housing investments in future years.

  Our national debt exceeds $28 trillion, and it is only going to 
continue to grow under the majority's approach to spending, not to 
mention the fact that it seems that this approach is creating a huge, 
huge increase in inflation. It is an inflation factory that we see.
  It is also clear that Members on my side of the aisle have made it 
clear that we cannot support bills that give excess increases to 
nondefense agencies, especially while reducing or shortchanging our 
national defense.
  We all know that, to move forward, we need a bipartisan agreement on 
spending, and the time for that agreement is now so that we can make 
responsible investments that create jobs and expand opportunity without 
the dramatic increases that we are seeing in this Nation caused by the 
spending of the majority.
  Again, at this stage, I cannot support the bill.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Maine (Ms. Pingree), the chair of the Subcommittee on Interior, 
Environment, and Related Agencies of the Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding the 
time. I thank her and Ranking Member Granger for their leadership on 
this committee.
  I rise to support the fiscal year 2022 Interior, Environment, and 
Related Agencies appropriations bill.
  I also want to thank Ranking Member Joyce for his collaboration and 
partnership through this process. It is truly a privilege and a 
pleasure to work with him.
  I want to thank the hardworking committee staff, Rita Culp, who is 
our clerk; Jocelyn Hunn; Janet Erickson; Kusai Merchant; Tyler Coe; 
Marcel Caldwell; and also my personal staff, Evan Johnston, Lisa Pahel, 
and Katie Bergh. We couldn't do it without all of their hard work.
  For fiscal year 2022, the subcommittee is recommending a total of 
$43.4 billion for the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill. 
This is an increase of $7.3 billion over last year's enacted level, 
which is a 20 percent increase. I am proud this bill makes long-overdue 
investments to care for our planet, to fight climate emergency, and to 
meet our trust obligations to Tribal nations.
  The bill prioritizes the protection and preservation of our 
landscapes and biodiversity, providing $15.6 billion for the Department 
of the Interior.
  It supports the administration's initiatives on climate change, such 
as the Civilian Climate Corps, and affirms the role of science as the 
foundation for decisionmaking. It funds a national initiative to 
reclaim abandoned mines and cap orphan oil and gas wells, and it makes 
investments in renewable energy development, including offshore wind.
  Climate change is causing more extreme weather events and drought 
conditions, as well as worsening existing problems such as the spread 
of invasive species. These factors are all contributing to the 
increasing threat of high-intensity wildfires in the West.
  The Interior bill not only provides $5.7 billion for wildland fire 
management but it also invests in programs to improve the health of our 
forests and make them more resilient.
  The bill also includes major investments to clean up pollution and 
protect human health and the environment. The bill provides $11.4 
billion for the Environmental Protection Agency, the highest level in 
the Agency's history.
  Across the country, Superfund cleanups are delayed because of the 
lack of funding. This bill boosts Superfund spending by 27 percent and 
will accelerate the pace of cleanup of toxic chemicals from the 
country's most contaminated sites.
  The bill adopts a whole-of-government approach to address 
environmental justice and invests an unprecedented $248 million in 
these efforts.
  Additionally, the bill provides $4 billion for grant programs to make 
drinking water and sewer system improvements, remove lead from our 
taps, improve air quality, and strengthen our Nation's recycling 
infrastructure.
  These grants have profound impacts on public health and the 
environment, but they are also economic drivers that create good-paying 
American jobs.
  Following our work in the CARES and the American Recovery Plan Acts, 
this bill supports the arts and humanities by providing $201 million 
for both the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment 
for the Humanities. The cultural sector has been particularly 
devastated by COVID-19, and this funding will help to support relief 
and recovery for community organizations across the country.
  Finally, this bill supports Native American families by investing in 
a strong and resilient Indian Country, including through education and 
healthcare programs.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Jackson Lee). The time of the 
gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman.
  Ms. PINGREE. Within the Department of the Interior, the bill invests 
$4 billion in Indian Affairs programs, including an additional $180 
million to address climate change impacts. For Indian Health Services, 
the bill provides an additional $1.9 billion toward meeting Federal 
treaty and trust obligations for healthcare.
  The investments in this bill would improve the lives of Americans, 
and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the ranking member of the Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee.
  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, first, let me acknowledge the 
leadership of our committee, the chair, Rosa DeLauro, and our Ranking 
Member Kay Granger particularly, in this sense, for their attempt to 
navigate this contentious process in which there really are areas of 
mutuality but are, unfortunately, marked also by irreconcilable 
differences.

  With that said, the agriculture component of this bill does reflect 
the cooperative spirit of both the American agricultural community as 
well as this subcommittee.
  Agriculture has the unique ability to unite across political, social, 
and economic divides, and I am particularly grateful to Chairman Bishop 
and his staff for producing a reasonable base bill here that we all 
hope can be refined as it moves through the process.
  Madam Speaker, production agriculture is a mainstay of America's 
economy. The vastness of our land, our ingenuity, and our technological 
prowess allow our Nation to provide the most abundant, low-cost, 
nutritious, and diverse array of foods found anywhere. Our trade 
imbalance would be so much greater were it not for this remarkable 
success.
  We are also empowered to meet our country's charitable impulse by 
moving approximately $2 billion in aid to persons overseas facing food 
insecurity. Investments in this bill build upon this amazing 
productivity.
  Here are some important highlights. There is:
  Support for what I call the Farm of the Future to enhance efficiency, 
regenerative capacity, and new forms of small-scale niche agriculture 
that marry high-tech with high-touch and, again, connect the farm to 
the family;
  Support for the Farm to School program, bringing healthy, nutritious 
food choices to children;
  Strengthened partnerships between minority-serving institutions 
within our land-grant system;
  Increased support for rural broadband and what I call the ecosystem 
of livability;
  More resources for unannounced drug plant inspections in China and 
India as well as a commitment to environmental security through 
investments in better cover crop practices and control of fertilizer 
runoff.

                              {time}  1615

  Now, here are the needed fixes. Ranking Member Granger has been right 
and clear in her remarks that the proposed nondefense increases across 
these bills are way too high, 10 percent in this bill alone.
  The bill also contains an unauthorized nutrition program that grants 
unlimited funding in the final quarter.

[[Page H4053]]

That is for the authorizing committee to take up.
  The bill also has a provision that makes unnecessary changes to a 
meat and poultry processing program that Secretary Vilsack originally 
proposed in the Obama administration.
  I believe that we can fix these matters and, hopefully, move toward 
an agreement as this bill moves through the process.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial 
Services and General Government.
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, first, I want to thank staff on both 
sides for putting this together. On the majority side: Laura, Marybeth, 
Elliot, Aalok, Parker, and Matt. On the minority side, John Martens; 
and from my own staff, Charlie and Max.
  I do want to thank Mr. Womack, the ranking member, who is a friend, a 
gentleman, and very easy to work with at a complicated time and his 
apparent insistence on being a Cardinals fan, as he just raised. He 
doesn't seem to mind when I bring up the St. Louis professional 
football and basketball teams, but we will leave that to another day.
  As to the bill, the bill recommends $29 billion. This is an increase 
of $4.8 billion over the comparable year of 2021.
  It includes $13.6 billion for the IRS, an increase of $1.7 billion 
above fiscal 2021, a first step toward restoring the cuts this agency 
has suffered. The increase will improve enforcement activities and 
support better customer service.
  Notably, the bill includes $330 million for Community Development 
Financial Institutions, which is $60 million above the fiscal year 2021 
level to provide critical resources to underserved communities.
  The bill provides $324 million for the Small Business 
Administration's Entrepreneurial Development Programs, which is $52 
million above fiscal year 2021.
  It also includes significant funding for the General Services 
Administration, including $300 million for a new Electric Vehicles 
Fund, $100 million for the GSA to manage climate change risks, and over 
$1 billion to modernize and improve the GSA real property portfolio by 
reducing their climate impact and improving resiliency.
  The bill also includes $300 million for the High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Areas Program, an increase of $10 million, and the Drug-
Free Communities Program is funded at $110 million.
  In the lead-up to our country's 250th anniversary, the bill includes 
much-needed funding for the modernization of the National Archives 
building, which houses the Declaration of Independence, the 
Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.
  The bill includes $8.15 billion in discretionary appropriations for 
the judicial branch, an increase to fund protective services and 
physical security needed in courthouses and ensure the continued 
operations of the judiciary.
  The bill also increases funding for agencies to protect everyday 
consumers and retail investors, including the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.
  I am proud this bill removes several longstanding policy riders, 
including many that dictate to the District of Columbia how to manage 
its own affairs or spend its own money or that harm and limit 
transparency in political spending.
  Finally, I would like to take a moment to highlight an issue that is 
a priority of mine, election security.
  This bill today includes $500 million for payments to States to help 
them meet the challenge of ensuring the real security and integrity of 
American elections. This represents our continued commitment to long-
term funding for election security.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. Joyce), the ranking member of the Interior and Environment 
Subcommittee.
  Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 
4502.
  Before I get into the details of division E, the Interior and 
Environment section of the bill, I want to thank Chairwoman DeLauro and 
Ranking Member Granger for their leadership on the Appropriations 
Committee.
  I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Chellie Pingree, the 
chair of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Chair Pingree has been an excellent leader, and I am glad I have had 
the opportunity to serve alongside her as ranking member on the 
subcommittee.
  The fiscal year 2022 Interior and Environment bill includes many 
bipartisan initiatives to conserve and protect our Nation's natural and 
cultural resources and to increase the Federal commitment to honor our 
treaties and trust responsibilities with American Indians and Alaska 
Natives.
  I am grateful for my home district in Ohio, and the States in the 
Great Lakes Basin, that the bill provides increased funding for the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. This funding is critical to our 
work to restore and protect the lakes for future generations.
  Robust funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is 
essential as we continue our efforts with Federal, State, Tribal, 
local, and nonprofit partners to delist Areas of Concern, address 
shoreline erosion, improve water quality, prevent harmful algal blooms, 
and control invasive species.
  I am also especially pleased that the bill makes critical investments 
in Indian Country, a longstanding bipartisan priority of this 
subcommittee.
  The $12.1 billion across the bill will help support healthcare, 
education, law enforcement, and other operational programs throughout 
Indian Country.

  Chair Pingree and her staff have worked hard to accommodate requests 
from Members on both sides of the aisle in this bill that will be 
appreciated by our constituents, regardless of party.
  Unfortunately, while I am supportive of the bipartisan components of 
the bill, I am unable to support the bill in its current form.
  First and foremost, the bill adds several new controversial policy 
riders that would curtail U.S. energy independence by limiting 
conventional energy and natural resource development.
  Limiting our domestic supplies of much-needed natural resources does 
not decrease our demand for them; it only makes us more dependent upon 
foreign nations to obtain them, which is not only a national security 
concern but also an economic security, environmental, and human rights 
concern.
  Our economy continues to depend upon on an all-of-the-above energy 
strategy, and these added provisions would undermine our ability to 
meet that demand.
  Similar riders were dropped from the final conference agreement last 
year, and the same must be done again before the bill can be signed 
into law.
  The Interior bill also eliminates or weakens several longstanding 
provisions that were once again enacted on a bipartisan basis last 
year. Adding these provisions back will be essential to reaching a 
bipartisan agreement.
  The bill before us today proposes a $7 billion increase in 
discretionary spending, with many agencies receiving double-digit 
percent increases.
  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress has provided trillions 
of dollars in economic stimulus and relief to help Americans tackle 
unique challenges.
  On the heels of this unprecedented spending, as we continue to 
restore our way of life and reignite our economy, it is imperative that 
the Federal Government makes the tough choices necessary to live within 
its means.
  So it is for a combination of these funding and policy reasons that I 
cannot support this bill at this time and in its current form.
  Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this 
package.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Cline), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding the 
time and the chair for her leadership as well. I am honored to be a new 
member of the Appropriations Committee, but I must oppose this 
appropriations bill.
  I was disappointed by the party-line votes many of my colleagues took 
during committee markup against amendments that should have garnered 
bipartisan support.

[[Page H4054]]

  I am most disheartened that the majority failed to keep decades-long, 
bipartisan provisions in this bill. Chief among those were the Hyde and 
the Weldon amendments.
  Since Hyde was first included in 1976, it has saved nearly 2.5 
million lives. Nearly 60 percent of Americans agree that taxpayer 
dollars should not be used to pay for abortions.
  The Weldon amendment ensures that healthcare providers cannot be 
forced to provide abortion services, a protection that has been in 
place since 2005.
  We should never force our healthcare workers to participate in 
abortion when they have taken an oath to heal and to do no harm.
  While there was much in this bill I would like to support, the 
inclusion of these provisions is non-negotiable.
  I will always stand to preserve the sanctity of life and to protect 
our healthcare providers from being forced to perform actions they find 
unconscionable.
  The government has a duty to protect the inalienable right to life. 
Therefore, I cannot support this bill.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House of Representatives.
  Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Granger for yielding, and I 
thank Ms. DeLauro for the work you have done, but I cannot support this 
bill.
  Before giving my short testimony, I would like to quickly 
congratulate Lydia Jacoby from Seward, Alaska, on winning an Olympic 
gold medal on the 100-meter swim. She is 17 years old. That is 
something to smile about.
  I want to thank, very frankly, the majority side. Thank you for 
getting me elected every time, which you do. Because every time we have 
an appropriations process, you add a provision in there preventing 
access to building roads in the Tongass National Forest. As long as you 
keep doing that, I am going to get reelected, so I thank you for that.
  In the over 60 years I have lived in Alaska, I have watched tens of 
thousands of jobs in the logging industry and support industries 
shrivel up and not be there anymore. These are working American jobs.
  The economy in southeast Alaska is hurting, and it is not because of 
a poor timber market; it is because of, very frankly, radical 
environmentalism.
  The timber industry supports great-paying, year-round jobs in 
southeast Alaska. Even though the environmentalists have already 
succeeded in locking up over 96 percent of the Tongass forest, 
eliminating most of these jobs, they are now after the remaining 4 
percent of that land mass. Where this idea came from, other than 
extreme environmentalists, I don't know.
  This is nothing less than economic terrorism, hurting a community in 
Alaska, which I represent. It is not just about timber.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Alaska.

  Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, it is about communications. I can't even 
build a road from one community to another community. No place else in 
America can that happen.
  So I am asking you to continue what you are doing, which you are 
hurting my State, but you are getting me reelected, so thank you very 
much.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing.
  Madam Speaker, the bills we are considering today have some fatal 
flaws I simply cannot support. Again, there is no agreement on top-line 
spending levels, and the bills include some of the most concerning 
policy changes I have ever seen in an appropriations bill.
  The package before us includes excessive spending, jeopardizes our 
security, reverses the provisions that protect life, and adds 
burdensome regulations. Moving this package is simply a wasted 
opportunity.
  This is a partisan measure. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote 
``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Madam Speaker, our country faces dire needs. Far too many people are 
struggling to put food on the table, to pay their rent. Many more 
struggle to afford childcare or the cost of education and skills 
training. The deck has been stacked for so long for the wealthy and the 
well connected, while our infrastructure crumbles and the existential 
threat of climate change looms. From the mountains of Appalachia to the 
struggling neighborhoods of our largest cities, the biggest deficit we 
face is one of hope.
  The moral test of our government today is how we meet these 
challenges. It is whether we can rise to the occasion and deliver hope 
for the American people who have been left behind for far too long.
  The bills before us meet that moral test. Their transformative 
investments create jobs, grow opportunity, and provide a lifeline to 
the vulnerable. They invest in our infrastructure and in a cleaner, 
safer future.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my support for 
H.R 4502, a bill which provides funding for numerous critical federal 
programs for Fiscal Year 2022.
  I want to thank our Chairwoman, Rosa DeLauro for leading the 
appropriations process this year and ensuring that our committee marked 
up all twelve appropriations bills. I also thank the Speaker, Leader 
Hoyer, and Whip Clyburn for working to get this bill to the floor.
  Lastly, I want to thank Chairs Bishop, Kaptur, Pingree, Price, 
Quigley, and Wasserman Schultz for their leadership in crafting each of 
these individual bills included in this package.
  This bill makes critical investments to fight poverty, hunger 
homelessness, and housing insecurity. It funds reproductive health, 
education and labor programs that create opportunities for our youth. 
As the Co-Chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I am proud that this bill 
removes the Hyde and Weldon amendments. These provisions have long had 
a terrible and disproportionate impact on low-income women and women of 
color. Getting them off the books will be a huge step forward for 
reproductive and racial justice.
  I represent a district in the Bay Area that has some of the biggest 
challenges with transportation and housing affordability in the 
country. This bill will help 125 thousand new families get and keep a 
roof over their heads. And it includes six hundred million for Housing 
Opportunities for People with AIDS, to help people struggling with the 
converging pandemics of HIV and poverty to combat both in tandem.
  This bill comes at a time when we can no longer ignore that systemic 
racism is at the heart of every crisis we face today--from the COVID-19 
pandemic disproportionately impacting communities of color, to the 
crisis of police brutality.
  Crucially, this bill includes my request to require HHS to develop a 
comprehensive plan to develop a National Center on Antiracism and 
Health Equity. This new Center will be a cross-cutting effort that 
would address the shortage of behavioral health professionals and Black 
men in medicine, barriers for people living with HIV, the need for 
increased research for diseases such as Sickle Cell and COPD, and 
empowering trusted messengers of our communities.
  This bill also funds a pilot program under the Office of Minority 
Health to oversee grants to support community-based organizations 
working to address structural racism in public health. I would like to 
thank Congresswoman Pressley and Senator Warren for partnering with me 
in this effort.
  I am happy to see increased funding for lifesaving programs such as 
the Ryan White Program and the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative. As the Co-
Chair of the Congressional HIV/AIDS Caucus, I will look forward to 
continuing to work with all of you to end the HIV epidemic by 2030.
  Finally, as the Co-Chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, I was 
glad to see cannabis research as a priority through various agencies. 
Gaining scientific data on cannabis will be valuable in further 
understanding its potential benefits.
  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4502.
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, the bill under consideration 
removes several longstanding pro-life protections and advances 
provisions that would force U.S. taxpayers to pay for abortion-on-
demand.
  It removes the Hyde Amendment which protects federal taxpayers from 
being forced to fund elective abortions--an agreement that has received 
bipartisan support since 1976. It also removes the Weldon Amendment 
which prevents discrimination against health care providers who do not 
want to participate in abortion.
  Similarly, the rule under consideration precludes even a vote on the 
Cole amendment,

[[Page H4055]]

which would restore the Hyde Amendment and the Weldon Amendment.
  The rule also denies a vote to my amendment, which would restore a 
law I authored in 1983--38 years ago--prohibiting funding of abortion 
under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Like the Hyde 
Amendment, that law must be renewed every year.
  A total of 14 pro-life amendments were ruled out of order by the 
Democratic majority.
  All is not lost, however. I remain hopeful--confident--that the 
Senate will reinstate all current pro-life protections, like the Hyde 
Amendment.
  Taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize abortion nor should 
anyone or any entity be coerced against their conscience to perform or 
facilitate the killing of an unborn child.
  The Hyde Amendment has saved more than 2.4 million lives--about 
60,000 per year since it was first enacted.
  If retained in law, more innocent lives will be protected.
  It is time, I believe, for more of us to face the harsh reality of 
what abortion actually does to children and look beyond the sound bites 
and slogans.
  No one in the media ever bothers to expose the violent methods of 
abortion that include dismemberment of a child's fragile body, 
including decapitation, and that one of the drugs in RU-486 starves the 
baby to death.
  Or that unborn babies killed by abortion at 20 weeks or later 
experience excruciating suffering and physical pain. And until rendered 
unconscious or dead by these hideous procedures, the child feels the 
pain of every cut according to medical experts in life-enhancing 
prenatal surgery.
  Abortion is not health care unless one construes the precious life of 
an unborn child to be analogous to a tumor to be excised or a disease 
to be vanqulshed--pregnancy is not a disease.
  Mr. Biden once wrote constituents, explaining his support for laws 
against funding for abortion, by saying ``it would protect both the 
woman and her unborn child.''
  Mr. Biden went on to say ``those of us who are opposed to abortion 
should not be compelled to pay for them.'' I agree. Most Americans 
agree.
  Over the years, the polls have consistently shown that Americans do 
not support taxpayer funded abortion.
  The January 2021 Marist poll found that by a margin of 58 percent to 
38 percent Americans oppose taxpayer funded abortion.
  The Marist poll found that a supermajority of 65 percent of 
Independents oppose taxpayer funding of abortion.
  Unborn babies need the President of the United States and Members of 
Congress to be their friend and advocate, not powerful adversaries.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) and the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Womack) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. Hern), my friend from Tulsa.
  Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, last year we lost Senator Tom Coburn, a dear 
friend of mine, and a legend in both this Chamber and across the 
Capitol for his consistency and dedication to the fiscal responsibility 
of our country.
  Tom taught me so much about the way our government works, about our 
broken budget process, and about the importance of spending American 
tax dollars wisely.
  It is pretty clear that a lot of my colleagues have forgotten one 
monumental fact: that the Federal Government has no money of our own. 
Every dollar comes from the American people.
  When we are in this Chamber debating spending another billion here 
and a trillion there, it doesn't come from some bottomless bank 
account. It comes from the hardworking American people, and we can 
never take that for granted.
  I have with me today Senator Tom Coburn's black book, an outline of 
his deficit reduction plan in 2011 to get the United States on track to 
eliminate our debt and balance the budget.
  My colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, has taken on Tom's 
mantle as the fiscal hawk of the Senate and now produces a similar 
report detailing the many, many line items of waste and abuse in the 
Federal Government.
  In his memory, I helmed the Republican Study Committee Budget and 
Spending Task Force this Congress, and we produced what is still the 
only budget introduced to the House. My budget is not only a clear path 
back to black, as my friend Tom would say, it balances in just 5 years.

[[Page H4056]]

  Our interest costs on the debt alone are expected to nearly triple in 
the next 10 years, making interest costs the third largest Federal 
expense behind Social Security and Medicare.
  As our spending continues to rise, so, too, do the concerns of our 
constituents.
  Our esteemed majority leader just criticized the Senate on their lack 
of passing appropriations bills. Speaker Pelosi has often said, ``Show 
me your budget, and I will show you your values.''
  It is alarming to me the Speaker abandoning her responsibilities 
outlined in the Congressional Budget Act for the third year in a row.
  This majority and their leadership do not care about American 
taxpayers, and they don't care about the fiscal health of this country.
  When I came to Congress at the end of 2018, our national debt was $19 
trillion. In just 2\1/2\ years, we are quickly approaching $30 
trillion. Our debt has grown some 58 percent. Meanwhile, our economic 
growth has been somewhere around 2 percent.
  In the past 12 months, our country has been devastated by COVID-19, 
both physically, mentally, and financially. With millions of Americans 
losing their jobs, businesses, or both, they turned to the Federal 
Government for help.
  Since last year, Congress has spent $13.3 trillion of American 
taxpayers' money on government COVID relief programs. To date only $8.7 
trillion of those funds have been spent, leaving us with $4.6 trillion 
of the American people's money in government bonds.
  Pelosi and Biden are spending money as fast as they can without any 
oversight into the effectiveness of what has already been appropriated.
  From day one of the Biden administration, President Biden and Vice 
President Harris have shown nothing but contempt for the American 
taxpayer, choosing to increase spending, increase taxes, and destroy 
jobs across the country. All they have to show for it is rampant 
inflation and continued unemployment.
  What we are looking at today is a drastic expansion of Federal 
spending across the board. My colleagues across the aisle are throwing 
money at every Federal department and agency except for the defense of 
our people, of course.
  Flagrant overspending is on the menu today. The Department of Energy 
will be increased by 7.6 percent; the Department of Interior's budget 
is expected to expand by some 19 percent; the Department of Labor by 
17.6 percent, with $4.2 billion to bolster Biden's unemployment 
programs, preventing people from returning to work.
  HHS is getting a 23 percent expansion, including $110 million to 
research the impacts of climate change and $400 million in Title X 
funding, which Planned Parenthood is now eligible for since Democrats 
are eliminating the Hyde amendment. The Department of Education will 
receive a staggering 40 percent increase in funding, and it just gets 
worse from there.
  Every penny they spend comes at the cost of the American taxpayers.
  When Oklahomans lose their jobs, Democrats will be to blame. When 
American job creation and wage growth halts, Democrats will be to 
blame.
  That is why today I am offering amendments to each division of this 
package to do one simple thing: cut spending by 20 percent.
  Speaker Pelosi doesn't want fiscal accountability, which is why she 
piled all these amendments into an en bloc, to ensure none of them 
pass.
  Congress has spent recklessly this past year, and the American people 
are sick of it.
  I want to thank my colleagues who have talked about these amendments, 
who have joined me in these amendments, who are wanting to speak today, 
and I urge adoption of this en bloc to rein in Democrats' reckless 
spending and ensure a fiscally secure future for generations of 
Americans to come.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  While I have offered this en bloc amendment for the purposes of 
legislative efficiency, I strongly oppose it.
  The amendment would cut funding for important programs and services 
that provide opportunities for working families. The simultaneous 
public health and economic crises of the last 18 months have 
demonstrated, once again, that these programs are underfunded. They 
fail to meet the existing needs across the country.
  A few examples. This amendment would cut Head Start by $2.4 billion. 
That leads to tens of thousands of children losing access to high-
quality early learning programs.
  It cuts the Child Care and Development Block Grant by $1.5 billion, 
at a time when parents want to return to work, but there is no one 
available to care for their children.
  It cuts the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It is a 
bipartisan priority, but it cuts it by $780 million.
  It cuts senior nutrition, including Meals on Wheels, resulting in 25 
million fewer home-delivered or prepackaged meals for low-income 
seniors.
  It cuts biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health. It 
is a reduction of 10,000 new grants for potentially lifesaving 
research.
  It cuts $2 billion from mental health and substance use disorder. CDC 
data shows that 93,000 deaths in 2020 were related to drug overdoses, 
the highest number ever.
  It cuts title I funding for low-income public schools, reducing 
needed resources for 25 million low-income students.
  It cuts special education grants to States by more than $3 billion. 
It reduces support for services for 7.6 million students with 
disabilities.
  It cuts Federal financial aid programs--the Pell grants, the FSEOG 
program, and work study--by $5.4 billion for students and families in 
need.
  It cuts funding for job training programs, resulting in fewer 
supports for Americans who are seeking better economic opportunities 
for themselves and their families.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on 
Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies.
  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, there is another issue that I am 
compelled to speak about regarding spending here. It is called the Hyde 
amendment.
  The Hyde amendment prevents taxpayer money for abortion, and this has 
remained a bipartisan compact in this institution for decades. Before 
now, little in Washington has been this stable or stabilizing, with the 
American people in clear agreement. Nearly 60 percent of Americans 
agree that taxpayer money should not be used for abortion. Now it is 
gone.
  When you look at the statistic regarding exporting abortion overseas, 
which we will potentially do if all of this passes, the percent of 
American people disagreeing with that jumps to 80 percent.
  That is right, we are about to export our most divisive cultural 
issue, our pain, our woundedness, on to the poor of the world. Pope 
Francis has called this ideological colonization. It is unfair, it is 
wrong, and it smacks of arrogance and elitism.
  Madam Speaker, we really are living in an age of contradiction. We 
say we want inclusivity, we say we want tolerance, we say we want to be 
an authentic community and protect the dignity and rights of all 
persons except one group of people, the expectant mother and her unborn 
child. Today we will break a near 50-year-old agreement to not use 
taxpayer dollars to fund abortion here or overseas. I am heartbroken.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, the Hyde amendment is a discriminatory 
policy. For more than 45 years, it has been routinely extended every 
year as a legislative rider, but the time has come to reckon with the 
status quo, a status quo that denies health to the poor, in this case, 
disproportionately denying people of color health services available to 
those who can afford this choice.
  The inequities in our country's healthcare system have been exposed 
by COVID-19. Systemic racism makes itself felt here, and it is time we 
insist on equality for women, particularly women of color. However we 
feel about abortion, we shouldn't deny health coverage just because 
someone is working to make ends meet.

[[Page H4057]]

  When Medicaid covers the cost of pregnancy-related care, including 
abortion, it means someone can make a decision based on what is best 
for their circumstances. Thirty-three States and the District of 
Columbia deny State funding to women seeking access to abortion. As a 
result, millions of economically insecure women in these States are 
hostage to their geography.
  I work every day to advance the respect for life and dignity for 
every human being. I believe that government has a moral purpose, and I 
am committed to helping the poor and the disadvantaged, reducing the 
rising rates of poverty, taking seriously the decision to go to war.
  We cannot pick and choose among life issues. Increased access to 
education is a life issue. The COVID-19 vaccine is a life issue. The 
Affordable Care Act is a life issue. Medicaid expansion is a life 
issue. Separating children from their families is a life issue. Gun 
violence prevention research is a life issue. Food and nutrition 
assistance, housing and homelessness assistance, supporting background 
checks, addressing climate change are all life issues.
  The bills today all address these issues, all of which my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle oppose. I am proud that the bill we 
consider today moves us forward, ensuring access to essential 
reproductive healthcare services. It protects women's health and 
empowers all women by eliminating these riders which for years have 
allowed certain politicians to insert themselves into a woman's most 
personal care decision. The decision to get an abortion should be made 
by a woman and her family in consultation with her doctor and in 
accordance with her own faith. The decision should not be made by 
people in this Chamber.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1645

  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is all the way from Grandfather 
Mountain, North Carolina, the ranking member on the Education and Labor 
Committee.
  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, this funding bill insults the intelligence of every 
American. Democrats think they can trick the American people into 
supporting far-left initiatives if they propose enough special interest 
spending funded by hardworking U.S. taxpayers. But we are not so easily 
duped.
  This bloated behemoth of a bill fritters away our children's future 
on duplicative, unnecessary, and unconstitutional programs. The 
legislation emboldens overzealous Federal bureaucrats to hound 
businesses struggling to recover from the pandemic with excessive 
Department of Labor enforcement actions.
  Tucked away in the legislation's fine print is a scheme to rig union 
elections and undermine the rights of workers. The funding package also 
strips resources from public school students, eliminates educational 
options for vulnerable children, gives taxpayer dollars to illegal 
immigrants, and limits opportunities for our brave veterans.
  As senior Republican leader of the Education and Labor Committee, I 
reject this radical bill.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair of the Subcommittee on Defense.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the en bloc 
amendments. These across-the-board 20 percent cuts undermine our 
historic investments in education, agriculture, housing, 
transportation, broadband, and many other priorities for American 
families and constituents.
  I want to thank Chair DeLauro and my fellow cardinals, as well as our 
dedicated committee staff, for their work in crafting a funding package 
that will keep our Nation healthy and competitive.
  As vice chair of the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and 
Related Agencies, I offer Chair Pingree my congratulations on an 
exemplary bill that protects human health and the health of our 
environment. In line with longstanding bipartisan tradition, this 
Interior bill provides funding to meet our Federal investments and 
treaty obligations to our Native brothers and sisters and Alaska 
Natives. The substantial increases in this bill are for the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Education, and the Indian Health 
Service, and it would all be lost with this 20 percent across-the-board 
cut.
  This amendment would slash funding for clean water and drinking water 
infrastructure, even as our Nation faces a historic drought and 
contamination from PFOS and lead.
  As chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I hear from my 
colleagues' concerns about national security funding, but the health 
and wellness of the American people, improving our economy, and 
educating our workforce are all critical components of a strong Nation, 
and that is the foundation of strong national security.
  Every dollar we invest on the domestic side in infrastructure, public 
health, and climate change contributes to our national security. If we 
truly mean to safeguard our Nation and its people, we need the 
investments made in these nondefense bills as well.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these reckless across-
the-board 20 percent cuts.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), a freshman from Silt, 
Colorado.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Womack for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today frustrated and dismayed because Congress 
continues to act as the Speaker's House rather than the people's House. 
Debate has been silenced and bipartisan amendments have been rejected 
for political reasons.
  I, myself, submitted 80 amendments to this bill, and not a single one 
was made in order. This includes three amendments redirecting Federal 
funds from bureaucrats to fight wildfires that are burning down the 
West. Forget voting on these commonsense amendments, Democrats won't 
even allow debate on them.
  I also filed three amendments to reallocate resources to help combat 
drought in the West--all ignored and all debate was refused. How about 
the amendments redirecting resources to improve veterans' mental 
health? Ignored.
  Do you know why the American people like Congress less than 
cockroaches, root canals, and Nickelback? Because of political garbage 
like this.
  Speaker Pelosi has silenced my constituents and the American people 
once again.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related 
Agencies.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose this 
particularly reckless amendment. Surely, we can do better in this body 
than undiscriminating, mindless, across-the-board cuts. It doesn't 
matter what works or what doesn't. It doesn't matter what deserves 
investment or what doesn't. Just cut it all.
  Look at the damage to individual initiatives including many, and I 
have singled out some, that Republicans are noteworthy for having 
supported at least in the past.
  Think about the FAA's Contract Tower Program that has been so 
important for aviation in small communities; our improvement and 
certification processes for major aircraft; the NeighborWorks programs 
to support expansion of affordable housing opportunities; the housing 
opportunities in this bill for veterans; the supportive service for 
disabled people; housing opportunities for all kinds of people in need; 
critical investments in our port infrastructure. Funding in this bill 
increases that by about a third, and on it goes.
  This amendment would not encourage DOT or HUD to do more with less. 
It would force our constituents to do less with less.
  Surely, we can do better than this. This is the opposite of 
responsible, discriminating legislating, and I urge defeat of this 
amendment.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure to yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence) from Columbus, Indiana, and a 
respected member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.

[[Page H4058]]

  

  Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4502.
  Inflation, inflation, and inflation, this is the biggest thing I hear 
about back in Indiana's Sixth District. Hoosiers in Indiana worry about 
the consequences the Democrats' tax and spend agenda is having on their 
pocketbooks.
  After this week, Speaker Pelosi is recessing the House until 
September, having done next to nothing to address the real issues the 
American people are facing: food, energy, transportation. Hardworking 
folks are already unnecessarily paying more. This Biden-flation crisis 
is hitting home. Consumer prices are at a 13-year high. In just 6 
months, Democratic leadership is compounding this crisis with a 
completely wasteful, bloated bus.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these hyperpartisan 
appropriations packages for the good of the American people.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman DeLauro for 
yielding to me, along with her staff for working on these seven bills, 
along with the ranking member, Kay Granger.
  Even though I know we do have some differences, I know we will also 
get together toward the end of the year. Having said that, I stand in 
opposition to the en bloc amendments.
  I also stand in opposition to the recent Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, NRC, conduct which runs counter to Federal law. The NRC is 
fighting massive opposition from elected officials, including two 
Governors, a Democratic Governor from New Mexico and a Republican 
Governor from Texas, and the public against the licensing of nuclear 
fuel storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico.
  That is why I offered and withdrew my amendment in the committee 
markup, so we can work and continue working as this bill moves forward. 
The NRC not only lacks the consent but is acting unilaterally despite 
clear opposition in a bipartisan way. The law is very clear. Section 
42, U.S. Code 10155, says that the Governor can disapprove--and again, 
both Governors have disapproved. Section 42, U.S. Code 10166, notice of 
disapproval, also talks about when the Governor gives the disapproval.
  Again, the Republican Governor from Texas and the Democratic Governor 
from New Mexico have done that.
  The law is clear. They have to follow the law, and we must clarify 
that NRC can only license a DOE-monitored retrievable storage facility 
once consent has been given by the State and the local community.
  I want to thank Chairwoman Kaptur for expressing her willingness to 
work with myself and Ranking Member Kay Granger on this particular 
issue that is so important to us.
  I am confident that the final version of this legislation will 
clearly establish the NRC consent-based licensing approval standard.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on 
both sides.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arkansas has 4\3/4\ 
minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 4\1/2\ minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), my friend who serves on the 
Agriculture and Education and Labor Committees, from a city unlike any 
other, Augusta, Georgia.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for 
yielding and also my colleague from Oklahoma for introducing these 
commonsense amendments to rein in spending and counteract the bloated 
spending package that our Democrat colleagues are ramming through this 
House.
  It is past time we tighten the purse strings in Washington. There is 
no doubt that we are in the midst of a Biden economic crisis, thanks to 
wasteful Washington spending.
  Just this morning, I hosted a telephone townhall, and I asked my 
constituents in Georgia's 12th Congressional District if they are 
feeling the impact of Biden's inflation. Overwhelmingly, 93 percent 
said they are paying more for everyday goods and they got less money 
every week.
  This inflation is a result of Biden's and congressional Democrats' 
spending spree, and here we are, debating more irresponsible and 
unrealistic spending that will do more to harm the pocketbooks of 
American families.
  When in the history of civilization has any Nation survived this 
insane spending? It is not sustainable.
  Families work hard to live within their means and manage their 
household budgets, and it is a dereliction of duty as elected officials 
to keep spending money we don't have.
  While many American families are suffering now due to the rise in 
inflation, our future generations are the ones who will eventually have 
to pay the price. I urge my colleagues to support the Hern amendments 
so that we can start to get our fiscal house back under control.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Trone), a member of the Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a Member of the House 
Appropriations Committee in opposition to this mindless amendment which 
would gut the important investments this bill makes on our Nation's 
physical and social infrastructure.
  Our Nation faces an unprecedented housing crisis. This bill would 
ensure 4.8 million people remain stably housed by increasing 
investments by $8.7 billion.
  Our Nation's infrastructure is falling apart. This bill provides 
robust funding for highways, transit, rail, and aviation, and we must 
do better for our Nation's veterans when it comes to mental health.
  This bill almost doubles the funding for the Veterans Suicide 
Prevention and Outreach Program and for the Veterans Crisis Line. These 
investments benefit our constituents from Montgomery County to Garrett 
County.
  Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chair DeLauro for caring so much for 
all Americans. I urge a ``no'' vote to this amendment and support the 
work of the Appropriations Committee.

                              {time}  1700

  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. Hern).
  Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I would like to spend my 2 minutes speaking 
directly to the American people.
  We talk a lot in here to each other and about each other and to one 
another and behind each other's back, but I want to speak to the 
American people because they are the ones who need to call their 
Members of Congress. You understand that when you increase budgets 30 
to 40 percent, and then my amendments are a 20 percent cut, that 
somehow that is destroying America? We know better.
  You, as the American people, know that you have to create a budget. 
Your counties create a budget. The cities create a budget. Your States 
create a budget. The only place in this free United States of America 
that no budget was created for the last 3 years is here in the United 
States Congress.
  My team on the RSC Budget Committee produced the only budget that was 
floor-ready for a vote, and the Speaker chose not to put it on the 
floor.
  Why, you ask? Well, I am going to answer the question.
  It is because the Democrats didn't want you to see what fiscal 
accountability and responsibility are.
  They didn't put their own budget on the floor when they had control 
of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. They could have passed a 
budget without one single Republican vote. Ask your Member of Congress 
why they didn't produce a budget.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to be fiscally responsible and 
accountable to your money, the taxpayer's money.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).
  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  We know that decades of Federal disinvestment have failed the 
American

[[Page H4059]]

people. Yet, this amendment attempts to gut the seven appropriations 
bills included in this package that will deliver critical funding and 
services to the American people.
  Coming from a coastal State, Rhode Island's roads and bridges cannot 
withstand rising sea levels and more violent storms. College students 
are struggling to afford both textbooks and groceries, and thousands of 
Americans do not have internet access at home.
  These projects will be addressed by the historic investments in 
working people and families included in this minibus, but the drastic 
cuts included in this amendment will derail this progress.
  This legislation will provide students receiving the maximum Pell 
grant with an additional $400 next school year, establish a civilian 
climate corps to promote conservation and fight the climate crisis, and 
create thousands of well-paying jobs rebuilding our Nation's 
infrastructure.
  Notably, it will address some of the most pressing challenges facing 
Rhode Islanders by providing over $9 million for nine community 
projects in the State.
  I thank Chairwoman DeLauro and members of the Committee on 
Appropriations for the extraordinary work they have done. This is the 
set of appropriations bills we can be very proud of because it is 
investing in working families.
  I just heard one of my Republican colleagues squawk about spending 
money. This is the same group of people who voted for $1.2 trillion tax 
cuts for the richest people in this country, the biggest corporations--
unpaid for--and they were all happy with that.
  Madam Speaker, this is different. We are investing in working people, 
in creating jobs for middle-class families, making sure of the 
investments that are necessary to get people back to work. This is 
something we should all be proud of. I urge everyone to defeat this 
amendment and pass this bill without delay.
  Madam Speaker, again, I end with deep gratitude to the extraordinary 
chair of the Committee on Appropriations for putting together 
appropriations bills that reflect the values of our great country.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining 
on both sides.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arkansas has 2\1/4\ 
minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Connecticut has 1\1/2\ minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Madam Speaker, you have heard from Members of Congress from all 
across our country, and there was a purpose in me identifying their 
hometowns.
  These are people who represent real American lives, and they are in 
touch with their constituents on a daily basis, in Augusta, Georgia; 
Tulsa, Oklahoma; Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina; Silt, Colorado; 
Lincoln, Nebraska; Columbus, Indiana; and in my hometown of Rogers, 
Arkansas. They all understand when the Federal Government is on a 
spending spree because they feel it in their own pockets.
  We are feeling it today with unrivaled inflation that is the result 
of trillions of dollars of taxpayer money flowing into this economy. 
The money that is going to the cities and counties, it was so much 
money that we had to do it in two tranches. Some of it has gone out 
this year, but there is so much that we have to wait until next year to 
send out the remaining $185 billion or so--money that these counties 
and cities didn't ask for and, in many cases, don't even need. In fact, 
they are taking suggestions on how best to spend it.
  Yet, here we are today, talking about a bloated discretionary bill 
that is going to further burden future generations by adding to 
deficits and debt.
  Madam Speaker, the interest on our debt this year is going to 
approach $350 billion. Let me say that again: $350 billion net interest 
on the debt, which would pay for more than half of the titles that we 
are debating here today of around $600 billion.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, this amendment would cut Head Start, cut 
childcare, cut low-income home energy assistance, cut senior nutrition, 
cut biomedical research, cut mental health programs, cut title I for 
low-income public schools, cut special education, cut Federal financial 
aid programs like Pell grants and work-study programs, and cut funding 
for job training, and so much more.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


     Amendments En Bloc No. 2 Offered by Ms. DeLauro of Connecticut

       Amendment No. 100 Offered by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of new york

       At the end of division C (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act 
     under the heading ``Department of Energy--Fossil Energy and 
     Carbon Management'' may be used for any research and 
     development activity other than an activity that has been 
     prioritized by the Secretary pursuant to section 961(a)(3) of 
     the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16291(a)(3)).
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) and the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Womack) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.
  Madam Speaker, the en bloc amendment includes a number of proposals 
offered by Members on both sides of the aisle. It includes amendments 
offered by both Democrats and Republicans and several offered jointly 
by Members of both parties on which the vast majority of this body can 
agree.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, 
and rise in opposition for a number of reasons, some of which we will 
detail in a more articulate way here as the debate continues. But 
suffice it to say that we have thrown a lot of money at the economy of 
the United States of America. While I realize that part of our function 
in government is to fund the discretionary programs of the U.S. 
Government--and that is an important function of our Committee on 
Appropriations--we have seen the other side take the opportunity to 
capitalize on a real crisis moment in our country, that being the 
coronavirus phenomenon.
  Trillions and trillions of dollars have gone out the door, fueling 
inflation and creating real problems for people at home who are 
experiencing rising costs in virtually everything that a consumer would 
purchase, from gasoline to groceries. You name it, those costs are 
escalating.
  It is not for any reason other than the fact that we have poured 
trillions and trillions of dollars into the economy while at the same 
time these very same policies have caused a lot of people not to work. 
We have incentivized this notion that they could stay at home and made 
it more lucrative than actually going to work.
  The people that we are going to ask to make things, build things, and 
produce things are the very people that haven't been functioning. As a 
result of that, the supply chain has been weakened. So, now, because of 
simple supply and demand, there are fewer products, and those products 
are going higher. As I say, simple supply and demand philosophies.
  But here we are today, basically adding about 20 percent across the 
spectrum of these seven titles of discretionary budget. A lot of these 
are very, very good programs, programs that we have all supported in 
the past. But with the amount of money that has gone to the coronavirus 
phenomenon, and the fact that a lot of that money has not been spent--I 
think the report this week by the GAO was $1 trillion of unobligated 
funds out of coronavirus. Here we are, adding insult to injury by 
compounding the problem by adding more to the nondefense discretionary 
side of the budget.
  Now, we will reserve the argument for a little later on what we are 
doing to national security by not pumping dollars into national 
security against the known threats that we have around the country. But 
as I said, we will save that argument for another day.
  We are going to argue and continue to argue that this is spending way 
too much money. The American people know that. That is why there has to 
be an adult voice in the room to bring these subjects to the light of 
day, and that is what our purpose will be today.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Speier).
  Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend, the chair of the 
Committee on Appropriations.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to block funding the 
DeVos title IX rule.
  Just imagine: You have endured the horror of campus sexual assault, 
and now you are asked to relive your trauma with live hearings and 
direct cross-

[[Page H4061]]

examination. You are told where you must be assaulted and how much you 
must suffer before you can avail yourself of your civil rights. God 
forbid you are assaulted while studying abroad or an off-campus frat 
party--title IX may be closed off to you. Or you are among the one in 
three survivors who drop out of college, so now your school is 
forbidden from investigating the complaint.
  It is cruel. It is inhumane. It undermines student safety and equal 
access to education.
  Madam Speaker, title IX should prevent sex discrimination, not enable 
it. That is why I appreciate this amendment being taken up.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Issa), a distinguished Member--and may I say a freshman 
Member, although he is a returning Member from before--a respected 
member of Committees on Foreign Affairs and the Judiciary and the 
former chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform in the 
Congress of the United States.
  Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I thank everyone here for giving serious 
consideration to amendment No. 24 to H.R. 4502.
  Madam Speaker, I speak today with my colleagues to support an 
expansion that was done under the last administration that has had a 
profound and positive effect on apprenticeships.

                              {time}  1715

  The amendment would simply allow funding to be available for the 
implementation of the Department of Labor's Industry-Recognized 
Apprenticeship Programs, otherwise known as IRAP.
  In 2017, former President Trump acted to enhance the skills and 
training options for all Americans so they may compete in today's jobs. 
IRAP expanded high-quality apprenticeship programs with a focus on 
rapidly growing industries like healthcare and STEM-based positions.
  IRAP apprenticeships were unique from the traditional government 
programs in that they were designed to be more nimble and responsive to 
the changing workforce that we find ourselves in today. Engaging in 
learning with new programs doesn't fit the old model, and the IRAP 
expansion is extremely important for the following reason. I support 
the apprenticeship programs that all of us are familiar with, the 
skilled trades and the like; but, in fact, today there are new skills 
that are being developed in which the curriculum must be nimble and 
must change.
  In just 4 months of operation, the program had 131 new offerings in 
the healthcare field alone.
  What better time than in the middle of a pandemic would there be to 
try to enhance nursing and nursing-like skills to be advanced?
  This is a time in which we are critically short in these areas, and 
with the return of a new variant of coronavirus we could well find 
ourselves in desperate need of a quick turnaround of new apprentices. 
If we permit this program to continue, it will eventually support 2 
million new apprenticeships.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to look at this in the most open 
and positive way, nothing could be more important today--particularly 
to the healthcare community--than, in fact, to expand flexible 
apprenticeships.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, as a testament to the gentleman's 
amendment, I am a proud cosponsor of that particular amendment and I am 
pleased that he has offered such.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I misspoke earlier. This en bloc 
amendment includes a number of proposals offered by my Democratic 
colleagues, and it reflects our shared values of investing in the 
American people to create good paying jobs, grow opportunity, and 
provide a lifeline to the vulnerable; and I urge support.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. McNerney).
  Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her hard work 
on this excellent piece of legislation, the staff and Democratic 
members of the committee, and all Members across the aisle for their 
hard work on these very important issues.
  I rise today in support of my two amendments to division B of H.R. 
4502.
  These two amendments draw much-needed attention to the energy-water 
nexus. Energy and water development systems have become more vulnerable 
as water scarcity and uncertainty have become more pronounced in the 
West.
  It is time for a more integrated approach to addressing challenges 
and opportunities, and my amendments encourage our government agencies 
to improve underlying data collection and analysis.
  My first amendment encourages the Energy Information Administration 
to conduct a more robust analysis and data collection of water 
consumption in the commercial and residential surveys and to make the 
information publicly available.
  My second amendment encourages the Bureau of Reclamation to address 
the energy consumption from their pumping stations to better understand 
the opportunities for energy efficiencies and to reduce energy use 
measures.
  Better data and analysis are foundational to identifying efficiencies 
in the face of climate change, especially in States where water 
processing uses a large portion of the energy budget.
  Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of these amendments.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. Castor).
  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Castor amendment.
  America's public schools, colleges, and universities are the engines 
of economic opportunity, and our funding package provides historic 
investments in students and schools at a time when they need it, 
especially in Florida where the Governor and legislature are 
intentionally undercutting our public school students and local 
control.
  Florida, the third largest State in the country, ranks 45th in per 
pupil funding, and it diverts an enormous amount of public money to 
for-profit charter schools that are not accountable and often fail to 
provide the full range of educational services required by law like 
those for special needs and disabled students.
  When my local school board in Hillsborough County recently questioned 
the quality of education provided by certain for-profit charters, the 
State Commissioner of Education threatened to withhold money from 
students and schools--the fifth largest district in the entire country.
  Many for-profit charter corporations need oversight by the U.S. 
Department of Education especially in Florida where they skirt civil 
rights laws and they weaken our traditional public schools.
  So I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for the 
oversight measures included in this bill that will help ensure that 
every child has an opportunity to learn and succeed, especially the 
students in Florida who deserve better.
  Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of my amendment.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Good), who is a member of the Budget and Education and 
Labor Committees.

  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my three 
amendments to GOP en bloc 1.
  My first two amendments would cut wasteful spending in the SNAP 
contingency fund which functions as a bureaucratic slush fund for the 
Department of Agriculture. Though its purported use is for emergencies, 
the funds sit unused in an agency account just waiting for the 
Democrats or career bureaucrats to come along and direct it at their 
will.
  My amendments would strike the funding for $3 billion directed toward 
this fund in the bill and rescind all of the money currently in the 
fund, effectively abolishing the slush fund from being piled up by the 
majority. Congress should not have to play whack-a-mole with slush 
funds for the other side.
  My final amendment would simply strike the provision in this bill 
prohibiting any limitation on Federal telework or union activity on 
official Federal time and in Federal office

[[Page H4062]]

space. This House is about to vote to require American taxpayers to 
continue to pay for bureaucrats to phone it in from home and perform 
union activities while on the taxpayer dime.
  In short, Congress is subsidizing bad service to the taxpayers.
  Remote work has created a backlog of over 2 million passport 
applications. I expect that everybody in this body is hearing from 
their constituents, as I am, about the backlog for passport 
applications. If someone needs a passport sooner than 4 to 5 months 
now, their only option is to pay an additional fee to expedite the 
process to 12 weeks. That is the expedited timeframe, 12 weeks with an 
extra fee.
  The House is now debating a government funding bill that prevents the 
ability of Federal managers to end telework and require that union 
activities be performed outside of Federal time and away from Federal 
office space. We must stop rewarding workers for not showing up for 
work.
  Without my amendment, this bill is nothing more than an abuse of the 
American taxpayer.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. Escobar).
  Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I am so grateful to the appropriators for 
including seven funding priorities for my district, El Paso, Texas, in 
the base bills, including funding for health technology upgrades, 
police body cameras, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, and 
much more.
  Each year I work to bring El Paso's voice to the table, and my 
amendments focus on our priorities.
  These amendments include increased funding for the Office of Civil 
Rights at the Department of Education to support economically 
disadvantaged communities; emphasizing the need for a binational COVID-
19 vaccination plan; funding for water reuse programs in communities 
experiencing drought conditions; and several amendments directing 
funding towards communities like El Paso, so we aren't left behind in 
the fight against the climate crisis; and so much more.
  Lastly, we have witnessed congressionally appropriated funding being 
irresponsibly diverted by Governors in States like mine, so I am happy 
to see all subcommittees under this bill include my congressional 
intent amendment expressing a strong urgency to ensure that States can 
no longer do this.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut. As I would want her to know, I am ecstatic about the great 
leadership of her chairwomanship as well as all the Cardinals who have 
worked, and I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many 
of whom really know that this is a very, very fine response to the 
needs of the American people.
  Might I just say to the chair of the Appropriations Committee, just 
very quickly, that I was here for the Hyde amendment. I was on the 
Judiciary Committee. I think my colleagues need to understand that for 
all the years of the Hyde committee, women who were poor, who were 
Medicaid recipients, many of them might have died in childbirth and 
might have had other important emergency health issues because they 
were subjected to decisions that they did not make for themselves. In 
that instance, we have discriminated against women just because of 
their poverty.
  Again, abortion is that of the woman, her faith, and her family. I 
believe this eliminating of the Hyde amendment is finally saying to all 
women in America that we respect you and your bodies.
  I am very grateful for the support of an amendment that recognizes 
the crisis of diabetes and the need for research professionals and 
patients participating in clinical trials. Diversity in medical trials 
is essential to ensuring that cures, especially vaccines and therapies, 
work for the greatest number of persons. So my amendment decreases and 
increases the amount for $10 million to emphasize and get more emphasis 
to develop that diversity pool in research professionals and patients 
participating in trials.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Scanlon). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an 
additional 30 seconds.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and ethnic 
backgrounds, particularly African Americans. I meet many people in my 
constituency who have had an amputation because they were not able to 
receive medical care.
  Finally, I have an amendment that increases and decreases funds $10 
million with the intent of supporting individuals who might not finish 
college because of the impact of COVID. COVID is now resurging but the 
delta variant is surging. People are being hospitalized, the 
unvaccinated.
  I make a national plea for people to be vaccinated.
  As well it is impacting young people. That means that we need to 
focus on young people getting vaccinated. They are in college. We don't 
know, if they are not vaccinated, how it will impact their education 
and their future life.
  So this is to provide the targeting programs to reach out to young 
people to tell them: One, get vaccinated. But to give them a bridge so 
that their education will not be interrupted, that they will never go 
back again, and that they will not suffer economically.
  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my amendments being brought to the floor. 
I thank the leadership and as well I thank leadership for all the 
community projects that are helping the impoverished in my district.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment No. 2 to Rules 
Committee Print 117-12, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 
25 and 26.
  I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and 
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chair DeLauro for including 
them in this En Bloc Amendment.


   Division A--Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and 
                    Education, and Related Agencies

  Jackson Lee Amendment #25, increases and decreases funds by 
$10,000,000 increase in funding to support greater diversity in the 
pool of diabetes research professionals and patients participating in 
clinical trials.
  Diversity in medical trials is essential to ensuring that cures, 
especially vaccines, and therapies, work for the greatest number of 
persons impacted by an illness.
  34.2 million people, or 10.5 percent of the U.S. population, have 
diabetes. An estimated 26.8 million people--or 10.2 percent of the 
population--have been diagnosed with diabetes.
  Approximately 7.3 million people have diabetes but have not yet been 
diagnosed (2018).
  Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds, 
particularly African Americans.
  Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5.2 percent of all diagnosed cases 
of diabetes, affecting approximately 1.6 million people.
  Jackson Lee Amendment #26 increases and decreases funds by 
$10,000,000 with the intent of supporting programs that provide 
outreach and support services targeting program participants at 
greatest risk of not completing a college degree due to COVID-19 
education disruption.
  I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amendment #2.
  Mr. WOMACK. I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).
  Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4502. 
This appropriations minibus makes historic critical investments in 
North Carolina's Sixth District and in all of our communities.
  This bill invests in new jobs and the future of our workforce with 
$11.6 billion for the Employment and Training Administration at the 
Department of Labor.
  It creates greater opportunities for students to succeed with 
increased funding for title 1 grants, HBCUs, and primarily minority-
serving colleges and universities, and an increase in Pell grants.
  It provides much-needed funding for the health, equity, safety, and 
well-being of our communities with funds for public health 
infrastructure, maternal and child health, and mental health. It also 
takes long overdue action to defend health and reproductive rights by 
repealing the discriminatory Hyde and Weldon amendments.

[[Page H4063]]

  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill to 
support the needs of families and communities across the country.

                              {time}  1730

  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).
  Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, long before COVID-19, the education of 
our most vulnerable students, particularly Black and Brown girls and 
students with disabilities, had been disrupted by discriminatory and 
harsh discipline practices.
  As early as preschool, discriminatory policies and practices push 
them out of the classroom. This push-out crisis and its 
disproportionate impact on our girls continued even as the pandemic hit 
and schools went remote.
  Last year, we learned the story of Grace, a 15-year-old Black student 
who was sent to juvenile detention for not completing her online 
coursework. At a time where our children needed to be kept safe in a 
volatile crisis, Grace was dehumanized and taken away from her family 
and her health put at risk.
  Advocates across the Nation, including my colleagues and I, rallied 
to call for Grace's release. We were so grateful she safely made her 
way home to her mother, but her experience is far too common.
  My amendment underscores the need for the GAO to study the prevalence 
of these practices during remote learning periods and provide 
recommendations on how we can work to urgently address this crisis.
  Our young people deserve nurturing, learning environments that 
support their healing and well-being.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, almost 20 years ago our country began 
sending brave servicemembers on deployment after deployment during the 
global war on terror. Around the world, they faced dangers not just 
from the enemy, but also from the circumstances of their service.
  Too many of those who served in areas of toxic exposure now bear 
life-long illness in exchange for the security they provided to all of 
us.
  And too many of those who faced the traumas of combat or sexual 
assault, now bear unseen and often debilitating burdens on their mental 
health.
  This is why I introduced two amendments to this bill. The first 
directs $1 million to Burn Pits Centers of Excellence, one of which is 
located in East Orange, New Jersey, for critical research.
  The second directs $10 million to expand vet center counseling 
services to additional locations, including in my district where a new 
vet center is badly needed.
  Our veterans deserve the best treatment available, whether their 
injuries are physical or mental. We owe it to them to support this 
funding.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Valadao).
  Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of my 
amendment No. 64 to division B.
  This amendment highlights the need to replenish the agriculture 
disaster assistance account of USDA's Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity 
Program Plus. This funding would cover agricultural producers' losses 
in 2020 and 2021 due to natural disasters.
  Some of the other types of natural disasters this program funding 
helps includes droughts, derechos, floods, extreme freezes, high winds, 
hurricanes, snowstorms, tornados, typhoons, volcanic activity, and 
wildfires. One of the most pertinent disasters this program addresses 
is extreme drought.
  It is no secret that the American West, including my district in the 
Central Valley in California, is currently suffering from a 
devastating, historic drought. One of the main purposes of the Central 
Valley Project system is to provide water to users during years of 
extreme drought.
  We are in year one of an extreme drought, and wells are going 
extremely dry and farmland is being fallowed at an alarming rate. This 
is completely unacceptable. While we continue to work to prevent this 
from happening again in the future, we also need to figure out a way to 
help those who are unnecessarily suffering from the drought 
immediately.
  My constituents and the constituents of many of my colleagues here 
today are in an emergency and need this funding to be included in the 
fiscal year 2022 package.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my friend from Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a 
general, who is a very respected member of the Foreign Affairs and 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committees.
  Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I thank the good gentleman, Mr. Womack, for 
this opportunity to speak.
  Madam Speaker, I have three amendments to this legislation. Amendment 
No. 180, this amendment strikes a provision allowing the HHS Secretary 
to use $7.8 million to hire and purchase electric vehicles and electric 
vehicle charging stations.
  If bureaucrats at HHS want to own their own $80,000-plus Tesla, that 
is great, they should purchase it. But they shouldn't require the 
taxpayers to pay for that kind of thing. They could do the work that 
they need to do without an electric vehicle.
  Amendment 121 strikes EVs from the GSA. Here again, the GSA want to 
purchase these vehicles with your money. Look, if they want do that on 
their own, that is fine. If you consider the post office, these 
vehicles are oftentimes heavier than your regular vehicle, but the post 
office has 200,000 of these vehicles and that is what they want to 
purchase with them.
  And just keep in mind that these vehicles don't pay into the Highway 
Trust Fund, so they are heavier, more maintenance, but not paying 
anything.
  Finally, amendment 124, which strikes the exemption for green vehicle 
purchases. The underlying text sets the limit at about $20,000. So if 
we are going to purchase a vehicle, that is great, you need to do your 
work. If you are working for government, you get $20,000 for a vehicle 
to do it. You don't need to ride in some kind of special luxury. But 
they set an exemption for these vehicles, because they want to buy an 
$80,000 vehicle and exempt the $20,000 that the rest of us have to deal 
with in the public.

  So this amendment would just say, no, we are not going to make the 
exemption. You are going to spend the $20,000 on the best vehicle for 
the taxpayer and for the government. If it is an electric vehicle, so 
be it; if it is not, so be it. The market should dictate and the market 
can dictate.
  The government shouldn't be picking winners and losers and forcing us 
taxpayers to pay for exorbitant electric vehicles because my friends on 
the left think that is the way to go.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Ms. Bush).
  Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in support of our 
amendments to H.R. 4502.
  Our first amendment provides $5 million more to support healthcare 
services, COVID-19 testing and vaccines, behavioral health services, 
and preventative care for our unhoused communities. As a nurse and 
someone who has been unhoused, I have both lived and witnessed the 
traumatic realities of inaccessible healthcare. This funding will save 
lives.
  My second amendment reduces funding for fossil energy and carbon 
management by $4 million and adds $3 million for energy efficiency and 
renewable energy. Environmental justice leaders are demanding that we 
stop subsidizing supposedly advanced technologies that keep fossil 
fuels burning in our communities, and build public renewable energy 
instead.
  Our third amendment supports $100 million in a new pilot funding for 
mental health crisis response by directing the GAO to study health-
based, nonpunative, and noncarceral approaches to public safety.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I have three amendments that 
I am asking our colleagues to support. They are bipartisan amendments.

[[Page H4064]]

  The first is a redirection of $3 million to the Centers for Disease 
Control for Lyme disease. I would point out to my colleagues that I 
have been working on Lyme disease issues since 1992, and we tried very 
hard for years to get a federal working group up and running. And in 
2016, we did it.
  The Health and Human Services Tick-Borne Disease Working Group found 
that there are about 300,000 new cases of Lyme every year. The higher 
estimate or guesstimate is 476,000 cases each year. It is exploding all 
over this country, particularly in the northeast where the chair, 
obviously, comes from, as do I. It is highly endemic in New Jersey. 
This additional money brings the total to $24 million for CDC to work 
on issues related to Lyme.
  Amendment 51, the second amendment, has do with LymeX. It provides $5 
million, through give and take, and underscores that we really believe 
the LymeX Innovation Accelerator will help find new diagnostics, 
research, and treatments.
  What the working group found and then what an NIH document produced 
by Secretary Azar, and others, found, was that we really don't have a 
diagnostic that works. We don't have a Lyme testing capability that is 
reliable and affordable.
  And, finally, years ago I founded, along with my good friend and 
colleague,  Mike Doyle, the Autism Caucus. We have been leading it for 
over 20 years. We have done a number of bills, including the Autism 
CARES Act, that have become law. Amendment 52 would provide $10 million 
to help the CDC's developmental disabilities account to expand the 
Autism Developmental Disability Monitoring Network, or ADDM, and at 
least nine new sites could be established.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, the ADDM network has been 
incredible in tracking children and young people to help us understand 
the prevalence. You can't combat something if there is no solid data. 
This ADDM network has been a tremendous asset. This amendment would 
expand it. So I thank my friend for yielding and I thank the committee 
chair for her support. I thank the Rules Committee for having made the 
amendments in order. It will make a difference.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I will just take the remaining few seconds of my time 
just to say this. As an appropriator, I am not a big fan of how all of 
this is being choreographed and structured, but I also recognize that 
time is not on our side. People witnessing this event, probably are not 
real sure what these en blocs are all about, but it is a simple way to 
save a little bit of time.
  Frankly, I think we ought to get back to regular order, where we can 
have a full-throated debate, an open rule, if you will, and just talk 
about each one of these very important issues one by one, and truly 
represent the will of the American people. That is what the Congress is 
here for. It was what it was built for.
  However, I do recognize that given the political circumstances we are 
in today, and the fact that we don't have a lot of time, that this is 
what we are left with.
  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the en bloc and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en 
bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


     Amendments En Bloc No. 3 Offered by Ms. DeLauro of Connecticut

     ``(reduced by $348,000,000) (increased by $348,000,000)''.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) and the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Womack) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.

                              {time}  1745

  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.
  This is an en bloc amendment and includes a number of proposals 
offered by Members on both sides of the aisle. It includes amendments 
offered by both Democrats and Republicans and several offered jointly 
by Members of both parties on which the vast majority of this body can 
agree.
  I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I won't belabor the point that I made a 
few minutes ago that I am not a big fan of this process, but there does 
come a time in the process where we come to some agreement on things, 
and I guess we are at that stage of the game.
  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pearland, Texas (Mr. Weber).
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendment No. 
109 within this en bloc.
  My amendment identifies an immediate need of the United States 
nuclear industry, the need to provide full funding for construction of 
the Department of Energy, the DOE, versatile test reactor project.
  As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy for the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, I know that there is no clean energy 
future without advanced nuclear. The best vehicle to accelerate us down 
the road of emissions reductions is nuclear energy.
  The versatile test reactor is an absolutely critical piece of DOE's 
R&D infrastructure that will allow U.S. nuclear researchers to validate 
and test a wide range of advanced reactor designs right here in the 
good old U.S. of A. Any responsible U.S. nuclear energy strategy must 
include robust support for this facility.
  Madam Speaker, last Congress, as part of the sweeping nuclear 
provisions in the Energy Act of 2020, we were able to authorize robust 
funding for the versatile test reactor. It was a tremendous 
bipartisan--that my friend from Arkansas is pointing out--achievement I 
was proud to lead. But this authorization is all for naught without the 
yearly appropriations to back it up.
  That is why I am very concerned to see that the 2022 appropriations 
bill provides no funds, zero, zip, zilch, nada, to keep the versatile 
test reactor project on budget and on schedule.
  If we are serious about our clean energy future, Madam Speaker, and 
we want to decrease our dependence on competitors like China and Russia 
for advanced nuclear R&D, we must commit to our investment in this 
essential research infrastructure.
  The United States can and should lead the world in advanced nuclear. 
Moving forward, I will continue to work with my colleagues to 
prioritize nuclear innovation and keep America safe, energy 
independent, and globally competitive.
  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Panetta).
  Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bipartisan 
amendment No. 10 that would bolster agricultural research.
  This amendment, offered with my co-chair of the Ag Research Caucus, 
Rodney Davis from Illinois, would support farmers all across the 
country in their ongoing efforts to produce bigger, safer, sustainable, 
and more agriculture.
  In my district, on the central coast of California, otherwise known 
as the Salad Bowl of the World, with its hundreds of specialty crops, 
the farmers depend on USDA research programs, not just to survive but 
to succeed.
  Two of those key programs that our amendment funds are the 
Agricultural and Food Research Initiative, or AFRI, and the Agriculture 
Advanced Research and Development Authority, also known as AGARDA.
  AFRI is the Nation's leading competitive grants program for 
agriculture research. Our amendment funds it with $450 million, a $15 
million increase from last year.
  AGARDA is a new program that was authorized in the 2018 farm bill, 
and for the first time, it is now funded with $2 million.
  During the pandemic, Madam Speaker, it was clear that the work of our 
farmers and farmworkers is absolutely essential. The least that we can 
do in Congress is to provide this type of funding for the necessary 
research that will help not just our recovery right now, but it will 
also ensure food security for our future.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Tipton, Michigan, Michigan's Seventh District (Mr. 
Walberg), a valued and respected member of the Education and Labor and 
Energy and Commerce Committees.
  Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to 
division A, which provides critical funding for the Office of Labor-
Management Standards, OLMS, at the Department of Labor.
  OLMS is vital to protecting the rights of workers in the workplace 
and ensuring labor-management transparency and financial integrity in 
our Nation's labor unions.
  Unfortunately, House Democrats have chosen to underfund the agency 
since taking the majority, resulting in diminished staffing levels and 
significantly impacting the types of work accomplished in the field and 
throughout the agency. Sadly, the appropriations package we are 
considering today continues this trend by once again underfunding the 
office.
  My amendment would simply increase the funding to be in line with 
President Biden's budget request. In the President's request, the 
Department noted that funding was necessary to restore OLMS' ability to 
provide unionized workers with the protections they are entitled under 
LMRDA.
  Protecting the paychecks of hardworking union members is my priority, 
and I hope it is the priority of my colleagues as well.
  Additionally, I rise to support my amendment to division E, which 
addresses two of the most serious public health concerns affecting 
Michigan and the Great Lakes States. PFAS contamination and harmful 
algal blooms have wreaked serious damage in our rivers, streams, lakes, 
and, ultimately, drinking water.

  Many States like mine have been aggressively testing, tracking, and 
working to combat PFAS for years. But there is still much more we don't 
know about these chemicals, and it will take collaboration from 
Federal, State, and local officials to prevent future exposure, protect 
the public health, and ensure the safety of our drinking water.
  At the same time, harmful algal blooms, HABs, affect marine, coastal, 
estuarine, and freshwater systems in all 50 States and are particularly 
prevalent in the Great Lakes. These toxic blooms harm human health and 
cause several billion dollars in economic losses each year.
  My amendment supports investments in science, research, and 
management to increase our capacity to detect and prevent HABs and PFAS 
throughout the country.
  I urge my colleagues to support these important amendments.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the en bloc 
packages.
  My first amendment adjusts Federal investments for the Federal 
Highway Administration to defund an expensive, unsightly, and 
unnecessary 60-foot-high artificial rock wall on I-80 in Warren County 
in my district. I encourage, instead, a safer, smarter option.
  The community which sits next to the beautiful Delaware Water Gap, 
one of Jersey's greatest natural treasures, believes this rock wall 
will be ineffective and that it will wreak havoc on the area's 
ecotourism. I couldn't agree more.
  This amendment makes clear that congressional intent is for no 
Federal funds to be used for the construction of

[[Page H4067]]

an artificial wall between mileposts 1.04 and 1.45 along I-80 in 
Knowlton and Hardwick Townships, New Jersey. There are safer, better 
options.
  My second amendment makes it clear that Federal investments for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must help 
address the COVID-19-linked substance abuse and mental health issues 
affecting far too many children and young adults in our country. The 
pandemic has caused a historic rate of mental health issues, especially 
with our students, and we must help them get the support they need. It 
is just heart-wrenching.
  My final amendment prioritizes clean drinking water because every 
child should have access to water at school that is free of lead that 
can cause great harm to them. This amendment adjusts the Federal CDC 
environmental health investment, creating congressional intent to help 
ensure that school drinking water is free of lead and dangerous 
chemicals. We must protect children in north Jersey and nationwide from 
dangerous chemicals and lead in their drinking water.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc set of 
amendments.
  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from San Angelo, Texas (Mr. Pfluger), a very distinguished 
member of the freshman class of this Congress, a member of the Foreign 
Affairs and Homeland Security Committees. I am proud of his service to 
our country in uniform as a pilot of that F-22.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the much-
needed student dormitory project at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San 
Angelo, Texas.
  The district I represent is at a crucial crossroads of national 
security, energy security, and agriculture security that makes our 
Nation stronger. At the heart of this district sits Goodfellow, home to 
the training of over 12,000 airmen, soldiers, sailors, marines, and 
guardians every single year who do intelligence work and also in the 
training of fire.
  Goodfellow plays a really critical role in continuing to provide 
world-class intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as 
that fire rescue that I just mentioned.
  The national security demands of our Nation are quickly outpacing the 
capacity of Goodfellow to house the ever-growing stream of new 
students. The base is currently experiencing a drastic shortage of 
housing. In fact, to meet this shortage, the base has entered into an 
agreement with Angelo State University for the use of their dorms to 
ease the capacity concerns.
  While ASU is a proud and willing partner with Goodfellow, this is not 
a permanent solution. We cannot expect our communities to shoulder 
these burdens forever.
  This project is vital to the national security mission that 
Goodfellow provides to the country and to that of the Concho Valley 
community. It is imperative that Air Force Education and Training 
Command maintain this project as a top priority.
  I am also offering an amendment tonight, and I rise in support of 
that, to strike the funding for the expensive and unreliable electric 
vehicle purchases by the United States Postal Service.

  Let me be clear. We cannot maintain a functioning and prosperous 
country without affordable, reliable energy. Yet, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are completely bent on pursuing a feel-good 
green energy policy to pat themselves on the backs in the name of 
saving the environment.
  But the truth is, they are not improving the environment. They are 
actually destroying the prosperity and security of our country by doing 
so.
  During several days of brutal cold in Texas, the city of Austin saw 
its fleet of 12 new electric buses rendered completely inoperative 
during the power outages. By allowing the USPS to go to an all-electric 
fleet, we are basically saying that when the weather is too hot, too 
cold, not windy enough, with not enough sun, Americans will not have 
their mail service.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment 
and others.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. Garcia).
  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, my amendment increases the Fossil 
Energy and Carbon Management account by $50 million and decreases it by 
the same amount.
  I want to thank the bipartisan group of cosponsors, including 
Representative McCaul, Representative Jackson Lee, Representative 
Burgess, Representative Fletcher, Representative Cuellar, 
Representative Crenshaw, and Representative Brady.
  I offered this amendment because we must prioritize Carbon 
Utilization Program activities that are consistent with our existing 
energy statute.
  In and around my district in Houston, the energy capital of the 
world, important carbon capture research is taking place. Carbon 
capture utilization seeks to improve our community's air quality and 
maintain and provide jobs for workers, many in my district.
  Therefore, my amendment just clarifies that carbon capture 
utilization research, along with other carbon capture projects 
specified in the committee report, are also recognized and prioritized 
in this bill.

  Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader of our 
conference, all the way from Bakersfield, California.
  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from 
Arkansas for yielding to me.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to division E that 
would prioritize funding for critically important U.S. Forest Service 
initiatives, to mitigate safety hazards, to reopen and rehabilitate the 
Sequoia National Forest following the devastating SQF Complex fire.
  Giant sequoias are the largest trees in the world. Some tower over 26 
stories high and grow wider than a city street. They can only be found 
growing naturally on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain 
range in California, including in my district, in the Sequoia National 
Forest.
  Last August, the SQF Complex fire burned over 170,000 acres, 
primarily in the Sequoia National Forest, after being ignited by 
lightning. A preliminary interagency report, led by the National Park 
Service, estimates that this fire killed ``10 to 14 percent of all 
large sequoias across the tree's natural range in the Sierra Nevada. 
This translates to an estimated loss of 7,500 to 10,600 large 
sequoias.''
  In modern history, we know of no other time to have this much 
devastation. In fact, the ninth largest giant sequoia, the King Arthur 
Tree, is still on fire to this day, almost one year later, and may 
ultimately die because of this fire.
  These losses are devastating, both environmentally, and for the 
communities. The giant sequoia and redwood capture more carbon than any 
other tree.
  But communities like Porterville, Three Rivers, Springville, 
Kernville, and Lake Isabella depend on the revenue from tourists coming 
to see the giant sequoia groves.
  Following the fire, the U.S. Forest Service closed a large portion of 
the Sequoia National Forest in Tulare County because of public health 
and safety concerns, such as falling burned trees and mudslides. 
Addressing these safety concerns is critical so the forest can be fully 
reopened as quickly as possible.
  My amendment supports over $13 million for three initiatives in the 
Sequoia National Forest.
  First, mitigating public safety hazards so the burn area can be 
reopened to the public;
  Promoting ecological restoration activities; and
  Supporting activities to reduce the risk of future catastrophic fires 
from killing additional giant sequoias.
  If you check, to this day, they believe there are only 5 percent of 
the giant sequoias on Earth still alive.
  I have spoken with the Sequoia National Forest supervisor and have 
been assured that all of these actions are or will be reviewed under 
the National Environmental Policy Act and will be conducted consistent 
with the Giant Sequoia National Monument Management Plan and the 
Sequoia National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.
  These ancient giants, some of which are nearly 2,000 years old, must 
be protected so they can continue to inspire

[[Page H4068]]

and amaze future generations. Funding through my amendment would help 
ensure this so the public can once again see these breathtaking trees.
  I want to thank Ranking Member Granger and Ranking Member Joyce for 
their work to protect our natural resources.
  Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of my amendment to division F to 
prioritize funding for the VA's Readjustment Benefits account for the 
Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses program, also 
called the VET TEC program, in fiscal year 2022.
  I was very proud to introduce the original VET TEC Act back in 2017, 
after hearing that veterans could not utilize their GI Bill benefits 
for nontraditional, technology-oriented nanodegree courses. After 
speaking with veterans in my congressional district and across this 
country, it was apparent there was significant demand from veterans 
interested in utilizing their GI Bill benefits for these types of 
classes.
  From these conversations, the VET TEC pilot program, which allows 
veterans to apply for and enroll in nontraditional, technology-oriented 
classes, was born. Now, over 2 years into the 5-year VET TEC pilot 
program, I am proud to say over 3,000 veterans have participated in it, 
with 90 percent of these veterans graduating from these programs and 72 
percent attaining employment in their chosen field of study. On 
average, graduates of the VET TEC program have an annual starting 
salary of over $59,000. That is approximately $25,000 more than the 
average salary in the United States.
  Since its launch in 2019, over 44,000 veterans have applied to 
participate in the VET TEC pilot program. That is far outstripping 
current funding. These numbers paint a clear picture: VET TEC is a 
popular and a successful program, and I believe that Congress should 
fund this program at its fully authorized level of $45 million in 
fiscal year 2022, which my amendment seeks to do.
  Even with this funding, the VA estimates it will need $80 million 
more for this program to keep up with the current demand. I look 
forward to working with my colleagues in the House to increase the VET 
TEC program's authorization in the future.
  Think about that, Mr. Speaker. Here are men and women who served 
their country that can use the GI Bill for nontraditional technology 
classes. In today's world, that is the workforce we need. They jump 
ahead. They get paid more than the average American. But the desire and 
the need and the applications are much greater than we fund. I think we 
have a responsibility here.
  I want to thank House Veterans' Affairs Committee Ranking Member 
Bost, Congresswoman Miller-Meeks, and Congressman Khanna for joining me 
in offering this amendment and for tirelessly advocating for the VET 
TEC program.
  I also want to thank Ranking Member Granger and Ranking Member Carter 
for their work to support our Nation's veterans.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Carter).
  Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a bipartisan 
amendment to protect our coast in Louisiana.
  I am proud to be joined by my fellow Louisianians in offering it 
today. They are joining me because this amendment reflects one of the 
most important tasks our State faces: restoring our coast.
  Put simply, if we don't restore our coast, none of the other work 
that we do really matters. Our coast is singularly important to our 
culture, our food, our industry, and our way of life.
  We lose a significant amount of our coast to coastal erosion. We know 
that our fisheries and our fishermen depend on a robust coast. We know 
that by protecting it, we protect our economy and we protect those 
things that are critically important to the State of Louisiana.
  Our coast is not only an economic powerhouse and an environmental 
treasure, it is also physical safety of our neighbors, our 
neighborhoods, and our visitors.
  This amendment would make sure that we have the funding to continue 
using dredged materials to rebuild our coast.
  This beneficial use is one of the keys to creating our new wetlands 
and is a large part of our all-out effort to restore our coast by 
rebuilding and shoring up our coast.
  I am proud to sponsor this funding, proud to have bipartisan support 
for it, and proud to ask that all Members join us in passing this 
incredible measure that is so important to Louisiana. This is not 
Republican nor Democrat, but it is good government. It is 
environmentally sound, it is good for Louisiana, and it is good for 
business.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. Cammack).
  Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment, 
striking language that would effectively allow unlimited use of 
additional contingency funding for SNAP.
  As I stated in my Rules testimony yesterday, when it comes to SNAP, 
this administration chose the playbook of the Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities to create a food stamp free-for-all.
  Recently, the CBPP wrote a piece that said: ``For other appropriated 
entitlements, policymakers have a simple way to protect against 
inadequate annual funding: by providing uncapped appropriations for the 
last quarter of the fiscal year to fulfill the requirements of the 
underlying law governing the program in question.'' In other words, 
let's hit continue on one of the biggest welfare expansions in U.S. 
history.
  The administration and the majority are taking the advice of a multi-
million-dollar organization and its leadership that thrives on creating 
dependency and making a lot of money by doing so.
  This slush fund of contingency money that I am talking about today 
has the potential to exceed $17 billion with unanticipated costs listed 
as the only parameter for spending. I can only guess what will, in 
fact, be labeled as an unanticipated cost.
  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment, start 
supporting solutions to end dependence, and help get people back to 
work.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify that if this amendment passes, it does 
not fund the specific project referred to by Mr. Pfluger in debate.
  I support this general type of funding, and the text in the summary 
of the amendment are general, but the Committee on Appropriations has 
established a process for consideration of a specific community project 
funding request. That process is designed to ensure transparency and 
accountability.
  The intention of this amendment, as explained by Mr. Pfluger during 
debate, appears to fund such a project without going through the 
vetting process. Accordingly, I would encourage my friend to submit the 
project to the Appropriations Committee under the established process 
next fiscal year.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. 
Spanberger).
  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my amendments 
to this legislation, which represent key central Virginia priorities as 
we rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic.
  I thank the chairwoman for her tremendous work, and I look forward to 
moving forward with this legislation.
  My 340B-related amendment sends a message to big pharmaceutical 
companies: stop hiking drug prices on consumers and discriminating 
against 340B providers and pharmacies.
  My amendment to boost funding for the Emergency Food Assistance 
Program reflects the requests I have heard directly from central 
Virginia food banks, their staff, and their volunteers, as they fight 
hunger.
  My bipartisan amendment to increase support for NRCS field staff 
would help crop and livestock producers implement conservation 
practices that help their bottom lines.
  As we look to maintain telehealth services that expanded during the 
pandemic, my amendment to strengthen Federal funding for telehealth 
resource centers would directly benefit providers like the Karen S. 
Rheuban Center for Telehealth at UVA, which serves so many of my 
constituents.
  Finally, my amendment to strengthen ReConnect funding demonstrates 
our continued commitment as a Congress and as a community to closing

[[Page H4069]]

the digital divide and expanding broadband internet access throughout 
our communities.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. Tenney).
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I am here today with the support of seven of 
my House colleagues to introduce an amendment to section B of H.R. 
4502.

  This amendment will restore the principle of good governance, 
preventing precious, hard-earned taxpayer dollars from going to the 
Civilian Climate Corps, which is an unauthorized program.
  As Members of the people's House, we have an obligation to ensure 
taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and that spending is held to the 
highest standards of accountability.
  Yet, tucked away in the House Democrats' spending bill is funding for 
the so-called Civilian Climate Corps. The Democrats transferred $5 
million, initially set aside for invasive species management, and 
directed it to this new program to fund bureaucrats.
  But there is a problem. The Biden administration and Members of 
Congress have admitted they don't know how the program will function. 
From what we know about this program, it will be a new massive Federal 
slush fund focused not on sound climate policy but on advancing the 
partisan Green New Deal agenda.
  Mr. Speaker, it is bad enough for government to fund a program that 
Congress hasn't authorized and can't effectively oversee.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bera). The time of the gentlewoman has 
expired.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from New York.

                              {time}  1815

  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, there are plenty of programs that are 
covered by this bill, including the 2018 farm bill with the mission and 
expertise to manage invasive species. The Civilian Climate Corps should 
be debated and considered in the House before it is funded; otherwise, 
this is just another bureaucratic slush fund.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to support my 
commonsense amendment.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my amendment 
to increase funding for the Adoption Opportunities Program in the 
fiscal year 2022 Labor-HHS appropriations act.
  On any given day, 424,000 children are living in foster care in the 
United States, more than a quarter of whom are waiting to be adopted by 
a loving, supportive family.
  Unfortunately, 20,000 young people age-out of foster care each year 
without a permanent family connection. How sad and tragic that is. That 
needs to change, and with the right support it can.
  The Adoption Opportunities Program provides a unique funding stream 
for States, counties, Tribes, and private organizations to invest in 
evidence-based solutions to find families for these youth and provide 
them with the support they need to thrive.
  From adoptive family recruitment to post-adoption services and 
caseworker training, these programs help foster youth build permanent 
family connections.
  Now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to invest in solutions to improve 
permanent placements for foster youth. I thank Chairwoman DeLauro and 
the committee for supporting this amendment and for her tremendous 
leadership in crafting this year's appropriations bills.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc package and 
the underlying bill.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask support for en bloc No. 3 
and these important amendments. Let me emphasize my first amendment, 
really, with a great deal of gratitude, because this is so very 
important.
  Human trafficking is a scourge on this Nation, and it has no 
boundaries; it is both domestic and international, but one of the 
things that is needed is for those who are trafficked, when they are 
found, to be able to cooperate with law enforcement. Many of those 
women are nondocumented immigrant women.
  My amendment says none of the funds made available by this act for 
domestic food programs, Food and Nutrition Service, Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program may be used in contravention of section 
107(b) of Division A of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence 
Protection Act of 2000.
  The effect of this amendment will be to make clear that nothing in 
this bill restricts the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or 
any Federal agency head from providing assistance and benefits to 
victims of trafficking under current law so that they can engage with 
law enforcement and get the scourge, the person who trafficked, because 
they take advantage of these immigrants, and they cannot survive if 
they don't have subsistence. Many times they are denied it, because we 
have not made it clear to the States they are allowed to have it.
  This amendment is going to save lives. I thank my colleagues for 
providing this particular amendment, and as well it is clear that it is 
needed, because it provides victims of trafficking access to 
information about their eligibility to receive SNAP benefits. It does 
not constitute the type of SNAP recruitment activity or advertising of 
the SNAP program prohibited by the bill, but more importantly, it helps 
those who are victims.
  Trafficking in humans, and especially domestic child trafficking, has 
no place in civilized society. It is the most lucrative business, 
better than drugs, and that is why it is--over and over again.
  Having held the first field hearing on human trafficking, I can tell 
you this is an important amendment. I ask my colleagues to support the 
Jackson Lee amendment and en bloc No. 3.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment No. 3 to Rules 
Committee Print 117-12, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendment No. 
68.
  I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and 
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Bishop for including it 
in this En Bloc Amendment.
  Jackson Lee Amendment #68 is simple and straightforward, but it makes 
an important contribution to the bill and to a goal that every Member 
of this body shares--and that is ending the scourge of human 
trafficking.
  My amendment provides that:
  None of the funds made available by this Act for ``Domestic Food 
Programs--Food and Nutrition Service--Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program'' may be used in contravention of section 107(b) of Division A 
of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (22 
U.S.C. 7105(b)).
  The effect of this amendment will be to make clear that nothing in 
this bill restricts the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or 
any federal agency head from providing assistance and benefits to 
victims of trafficking under current law as authorized by 22 U.S.C. 
Sec. 7105(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act 
of 2000 (114 Stat. 1464, Pub. Law 106-386).
  In particular, Jackson Lee Amendment #68 is necessary to make clear 
that providing victims of trafficking access to information about their 
eligibility to receive SNAP benefits does not constitute the type of 
SNAP recruitment activities or ``advertising'' of the SNAP program 
prohibited by the bill and by Section 4018 of the Agriculture Act of 
2014 (Public Law No: 113-079).
  Trafficking in humans, and especially domestic child trafficking, has 
no place in a civilized society. Those who engage in this illicit trade 
should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This House made 
that clear again last month when it passed H.R. 3530, the Justice for 
Victims of Trafficking Act, which contained my Sense of the Congress 
amendment added during the Judiciary Committee markup.
  That means we need to ensure that state and local law enforcement 
agencies have the tools, resources, and training necessary to identify, 
apprehend, and prosecute criminals who ruthless traffic in children and 
young persons.
  And one of the most effective resources in bringing criminals to 
justice is the cooperation and assistance of their victims.
  Perpetrators of crime know that they are more likely to evade 
detection and punishment when their victims refuse to assist or 
cooperate with law enforcement. That is why they make it a point to 
instill fear in their victims--for their own safety or that of family 
and loved ones.
  I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amendment #3.

[[Page H4070]]

  

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I support this amendment and hope that 
Members will vote for it.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I support this amendment and urge Members 
to pass it.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendments to H.R. 4502, the Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Education, Agriculture, Rural Development, Energy and Water 
Development, Financial Services and General Government, Interior, 
Environment, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, 
and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act of 2022.
  These three amendments, included in en bloc three, support essential 
funding for our National Labs. The first amendment, which I introduced 
with Reps. Wittman, Beyer, Luria, and Wexton of Virginia; Reps. Suozzi 
and Rice of New York; and Rep. Slotkin of Michigan, highlights the need 
for funding for Medium Energy Operations and Nuclear Physics within the 
Department of Energy's Office of Science. The funding level included in 
the President's Budget would advance our understanding of nuclear 
physics, study which enhances safety, quality of life, and even medical 
care. Scientists and researchers at Thomas Jefferson National 
Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), located in the heart of my 
district in Newport News, train the next generation of scientists, 
advance lifesaving cancer radiation therapies, and have been awarded 
more than 150 patents. Insufficient funding for Nuclear Physics and 
Medium Energy research would jeopardize Jefferson Lab's run times, 
contributing to an increased backlog of experiments ultimately slowing 
innovation and decreasing the United States' scientific achievements.
  Given the incredible work that Jefferson Lab does, I also submitted 
an amendment to encourage much needed investment in the Electron-Ion 
Collider, on which scientists at Jefferson National Laboratory and 
Brookhaven National Laboratory are collaborating. Again, the funding 
level included in the President's Budget Request is essential to moving 
this critical project forward. I thank my colleagues Reps. Wittman, 
Beyer, Luria, Wexton, Suozzi, and Rice for their support of this 
effort. By supporting the development of the Electron-Ion Collider, we 
enable researchers to answer pressing physics questions about the world 
in which we live.
  Lastly, I was pleased to see funding for the High Performance Data 
Facility to support real-time analysis for experiments across the 
National Laboratories included in the President's Budget. The proposed 
facility would meet the needs of increasingly complex research projects 
across the labs. Jefferson Lab, the first National Lab to deploy a 
graphics processing unit for scientific computing, is incredibly well-
suited to house this facility on the East Coast. Establishing the 
facility at Jefferson Lab would not only increase the National 
Laboratories' computing capacity, it would also enhance their 
resilience and help Jefferson Lab achieve its vision for a diversified 
scientific mission moving forward. I thank my colleagues Reps. Wittman, 
Beyer, Luria, and Wexton for their support of this amendment.
  These amendments, like the underlying bill, help us move forward, 
spurring innovation, creating jobs, facilitating incredible discovery. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill and these amendments.
  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc 3, which 
includes my amendment to the Labor-HHS-Education Division of H.R. 4502, 
the minibus Appropriations Act.
  My amendment will provide an additional $2 million to the Health 
Centers Program within the Department of Health and Human Services. 
This funding will provide increased assistance to our community health 
centers which serve as a lifeline to many of the most vulnerable 
members of our community, and have been hit especially hard during the 
pandemic.
  Today there are around 1,400 health centers in over 14,000 urban and 
rural communities, across the U.S. serving 30 million patients in every 
state and territory. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic they provided 
vital comprehensive, quality health services--including, primary and 
preventive care, behavioral health, dental care, pharmacy, and vision 
care--to vulnerable and underserved communities. In recent years, they 
have been expanding their services to include mental health and 
treatment of substance use disorder.
  Throughout the pandemic crisis, community health centers have stepped 
up to help their communities by providing essential testing, contact 
tracing, education, and vaccinations. And they have done so while 
continuing to meet the ongoing health care needs of their patients. 
However, these vital health care providers, who already operate on very 
tight budgets with thin margins, were stretched even thinner in the 
last eighteen months. At a time when they needed all hands on deck, 
community health centers around the country had to cut hours, reduce 
services, and lay off or furlough employees. Some even had to shut down 
temporarily.
  As we continue to work our way through to the other side of the 
pandemic, community health centers still need our support to care for 
our vulnerable and underserved Americans. Thanks to the efforts of the 
Congress and the support of the President, our health centers have been 
given some of the assistance they need in order to do so. Fortunately, 
the American Rescue Plan provided over $6.1 billion in funding to 1,377 
health centers around the country. In my state of Massachusetts, 37 
community health centers have received over $146 million to help them 
continue their work.
  I was pleased to see the substantial increase that the Appropriations 
Committee provided to health centers in this spending bill, and again, 
I appreciate the Committee's acceptance of my amendment which will help 
our community health centers to continue to provide quality, 
comprehensive health care to millions of Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this En Bloc amendment and the 
underlying bill.
  Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 4502, the consolidated appropriations legislation that will fund, 
among other Federal agencies, the Department of Health and Human 
Services, including the National Institutes of Health.
  This bill represents a strong investment in our national health care 
infrastructure, workforce, and research and development enterprise--and 
I thank Chairwoman DeLauro for her strong leadership in ensuring that 
Congress invests in the health of the American people as we continue to 
recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the health care challenges 
are more diverse than COVID-19 alone and warrant our careful attention 
and consideration. The historic investments in the National Institutes 
of Health, National Cancer Institute, and other health agencies are 
critical to addressing many of these health conditions and social 
issues.
  I offered my amendment to this bill to address a critical gap in our 
fight to improve care for and save the lives of America's most 
vulnerable children--pediatric brain cancer patients. We have invested 
in intensive clinical and biological research for years, including 
through the National Cancer Institute, to investigate the origins of 
and therapeutic options for pediatric cancers, but the mortality of 
children with brain cancer remains high and is the leading cause of 
pediatric cancer deaths.
  While brain tumors are rare in number among pediatric patients, the 
vulnerability of the patient population, combined with the array of 
tumor subtypes, makes investigating and treating this terrible 
condition a unique challenge for researchers. The National Cancer 
lnstitute's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative is one effort to undertake 
the difficult work of collecting phenotypic and genotypic data for 
pediatric cancer patients to inform the biologic and molecular 
underpinnings of these rare cancers.
  I fully support this initiative--and my amendment would strengthen 
its current work by directing the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative to 
incorporate a key tool for researchers into its workflow--molecular 
tumor board data. Molecular tumor boards use information from each 
patient's tumor, including derived genotype and RNA and DNA profiling, 
and links research to the clinical characteristics of the child, to 
inform treatment decisions. These data sets are a rich source of real-
world information that clinical scientists, treating physicians, and 
families will be able to use in real time to make critical decisions on 
care. Over time, they will improve our understanding of pediatric 
cancers' origins and functions and also assist in the development of 
new drugs, treatments, and potential cures.
  Specifically, my amendment provides $2 million in further resources 
for the National Cancer Institute's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, 
which should be sufficient resources to incorporate data from the 2000 
most highly malignant brain tumor cases that occur in American children 
each year. The Initiative is well positioned to incorporate molecular 
tumor board data from diverse patients across the country, to work with 
academic centers that have the expertise to review the data and suggest 
treatment options, provide tumor board report information to patients 
and families, and to follow cases for clinical endpoints on a 
longitudinal basis.
  Mr. Speaker, America's scientific and medical communities lead the 
world in groundbreaking, lifesaving research, and this bill rightly 
invests in furthering that national interest and strength. My amendment 
builds on this goal by centering research on some of the most 
vulnerable patients and some of the most unique and deadly health 
conditions that affect America's children. These tumors and cancers 
need innovative strategies to improve

[[Page H4071]]

care, quality of life, and survival. This research addresses the needs 
of pediatric brain cancer patients and their families to access 
precision-based therapeutics and medical experts. I urge my colleagues 
to support my amendment and the underlying bill to invest in the health 
of America's kids.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) and the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. Simpson) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, my amendment defends religious organizations 
under attack from the radical left. Democrat politicians' distrust of 
religious entities does not entitle them to ban them unconstitutionally 
from participating in Federal programs and contracts.
  President Biden and other Democrat politicians continue to target 
faith-based entities despite repeated rebuke from the U.S. Supreme 
Court. Democrats' unfounded fear of religious Federal contractors is, 
in fact, a form of discrimination. Religious organizations that 
contract with the Federal Government must still abide by 
nondiscrimination laws.
  We must protect the valuable Department of Labor regulation that 
provides certainty and predictability for Federal contractors and 
upholds the rights of all Americans.
  Religious freedom is a nonnegotiable right. My amendment upholds the 
Constitution and supports the right of religious organizations to do 
business with the Federal Government.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on Foxx amendment 16.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  While I have offered this en bloc amendment for the purposes of 
legislative efficiency, I strongly oppose it. The en bloc makes severe 
harmful changes to the bills under consideration.
  Within the Labor-HHS-Education division, the amendment would support 
discrimination, it would attack workers' rights, cut money from 
education, put affordable child care further out of reach for families.
  The amendment strikes a general provision from the bill that 
prohibits funding to organizations that do not follow the Federal 
regulation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, 
disability, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, gender 
identity, or sexual orientation.
  Under the previous administration, HHS used taxpayer dollars to fund 
child welfare organizations that were willing to discriminate against 
families.
  The United States has over 400,000 children in foster care, over 
125,000 of whom are waiting to be adopted. Children in foster care need 
and deserve every chance to be placed in loving homes.
  America's workers, this amendment prohibits the Department of Labor 
from revising the previous administration's antiworker rule, granting 
taxpayer-funded contractors the extraordinary power to hire and fire 
employees based on religious beliefs. The rule weakens antibias 
protections for workers by shielding Federal contractors from complying 
with workplace antidiscrimination laws.
  The amendment undermines the highly successful registered 
apprenticeship grant program by wasting taxpayer funds on low-quality, 
predatory programs with no accountability.
  At a time when quality, affordable education is more important than 
ever, this amendment cuts $122 million from the higher education 
account and the underlying bill. The amendment takes money away from 
Hispanic-serving institutions, historically Black colleges and 
universities, Tribal colleges and universities, Asian-American and 
Native-American Pacific Islander-serving institutions, and other 
minority-serving institutions.
  Finally, as our Nation faces a childcare crisis, the amendment 
reduces childcare options for student parents who rely on university 
childcare programs supported by the Childcare Access Means Parents in 
Schools Program.
  Harmful changes. This barely scratches the surface of funding cuts 
and harmful policy provisions espoused in this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this en bloc. I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment that 
is included in this en bloc. My amendment strikes section 241, which 
requires foster care and adoption agencies to comply with Obama-era 
regulations on sexual orientation and gender identity and prohibits the 
use of funds to grant exceptions.
  Section 241 is an attack on religious liberty. Similar provisions 
allowed the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to refuse a contract 
with Catholic Social Services unless they certified same-sex couples as 
foster parents.

  My amendment ensures that faith-based adoption and foster care 
agencies do not have to choose between their ministry and their faith. 
It is tyrannical for the government to force these entities to choose 
between the two.
  It is our job in Congress to uphold our constitutional right of 
religious freedom. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Schrader).
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my 
amendment to ask the FDA to move forward with rulemaking on 
cannabidiol. Despite the 2018 farm bill being signed into law 
legalizing cannabidiol, hemp farmers, including those in my home State 
of Oregon, have faced economic burdens from the regulatory uncertainty 
by lack of action.
  We have legalized the sale of hemp derivatives like CBD, but the 
marketplace adoption has not taken off like Congress and hemp farmers 
alike expected. Lack of clarity in legal purchasing of CBD is a big 
part of the problem.

[[Page H4073]]

  The FDA has the authority to conduct the necessary rulemaking to 
establish a regulatory pathway for CBD as a dietary supplement and food 
ingredient.
  This amendment, with my colleague Representative Griffith, calls on 
the FDA to proceed in doing so, as the livelihoods of hemp farmers and 
safety of consumers across the country reside in the hands of the 
agency. There is no reason for the FDA not to be moving forward since 
the 2018 farm bill.
  To that end, I have also introduced with Representative Griffith H.R. 
841 on a bipartisan basis. My bill will require the FDA to do what they 
have the authority to do and should have done already to craft the 
necessary rules and guidance to regulate CBD as a dietary supplement.
  No regulatory system is perfect, but congressional intent has been 
clear on hemp and CBD. The livelihoods of the farmers and agriculture 
jobs hang in the balance. It is long past time the FDA and Congress 
move forward with making CBD legal and safe for consumers.

                              {time}  1830

  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I support this amendment, and I encourage 
my colleagues to support it also. I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, for the reasons I spoke of earlier, I urge 
a defeat of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my amendment, No. 
89, drawing attention to the lack of funding for the Uranium Reserve 
Program in this bill. I would like to thank the Rules committee for 
making this amendment in order, although I was disappointed that many 
other crucial amendments I supported will not be debated or voted on by 
the full House, including many that would have preserved the 
protections for unborn lives that have been included in every other 
appropriations bill in recent memory.
  The Department of Energy's Uranium Reserve Program is critical to 
both our energy industry and national security. In the Fiscal Year 21 
appropriations, this program was funded at 75 million dollars, but it 
was not included this year at all. This program will play an important 
role in reviving domestic uranium production and will bring new jobs to 
states like Wyoming. Uranium, despite what this administration may 
believe, is a critical mineral that is essential to our energy 
security, armed forces, and strategic deterrence.
  The Uranium Reserve Program was designed to address identified risks 
to the unobligated uranium supply chain including the loss of domestic 
uranium mining and enrichment capabilities, and defunding it will only 
serve to make the United States more dependent on unreliable foreign 
sources owned by China and Russia. This is not the time to expand our 
reliance on these countries. Instead of stifling domestic production of 
uranium, we should be expanding it.
  I hope the Chair and Ranking Member will work with me, moving 
forward, to ensure this important program receives adequate funding. I 
hope eliminating the Uranium Reserve Program from this year's Energy 
and Water appropriations was simply an oversight and the result of a 
rushed, partisan process, and that this can be remedied before the 
September 30 deadline.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


                 Amendment No. 29 Offered by Mrs. Lesko

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
29 printed in part B of House Report 117-109.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Strike section 316 of division A.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  My amendment strikes section 316.
  Under current law, universities are already allowed to conduct 
research on marijuana as long as the university gets approval from the 
Drug Enforcement Agency and buys the marijuana from the University of 
Mississippi, the DEA's approved provider.
  Additionally, universities are currently required to comply with the 
Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act which prohibits universities from 
unlawfully manufacturing, distributing and dispensing, or possessing a 
controlled substance. A violation of this law would result in a loss of 
Federal funding.
  Democrats want to change all of this. Section 316 allows universities 
to skirt these requirements.
  If universities are allowed to engage in cannabis growing and 
research without any safeguards, who is to say that this provision 
would not permit universities to offer a class called Pot Smoking 101, 
dedicated to smoking pot under the false pretense of research.
  Pushing for marijuana research in universities also fails to account 
for the fact that because marijuana is a schedule I drug, Federal law 
requires certain safeguards, including a limited-access room and a 
specific storage safe for the drug.
  My amendment allows for the withholding of Federal funds if 
universities fail to implement these necessary safeguards. An 
appropriations package is, quite simply, not the place for debate on a 
legalization of or looser restrictions for marijuana.
  My colleagues across the aisle are using this partisan package as a 
roundabout way of legalizing marijuana without having any meaningful 
debate about its classification as a schedule I drug or the effects 
that the drug has on Americans' health.
  This appropriations package should not be an opportunity to push an 
agenda without meaningful debate about the consequences of legalizing a 
schedule I drug.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Connecticut is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, through scientific research, institutions 
of higher education advance our understanding, advance our knowledge of 
various aspects of our world, expands our knowledge. Without such 
research, there would be limited scientific discovery and breakthroughs 
helping to shape our daily lives.
  As more States and localities move to legalize cannabis, including my 
home State of Connecticut earlier this month, many institutions of 
higher education are expanding the knowledge base on this controlled 
substance, offering scientific information to better inform 
decisionmaking and medical use.
  What are its properties for medical use? I don't know. I am not a 
scientist. I am not a medical professional. That is what science is 
about, to expand our minds, to give us information about what 
directions we ought to take.
  In advancing our understanding of cannabis, many institutions fear 
that they will lose access to Federal funding because of the Drug-Free 
Schools and Communities Act, which, in part, prohibits the possession 
of a controlled substance, including cannabis.
  The underlying bill includes a provision to prohibit the Department 
of Education from penalizing institutions of higher education that 
conduct scientific research on marijuana. Evidence-based research 
regarding cannabis ought to be encouraged in academic settings, not 
discouraged. We should ensure that we broaden our understanding of 
marijuana, not limit it.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, universities are already allowed to do 
research on marijuana as long as they follow DEA and other safety 
guidelines.
  The problem with inserting section 316 is it takes away those 
safeguards,

[[Page H4074]]

so I would say that there should be no concern that my amendment will 
stop research in universities.
  In fact, universities are allowed to do it now and will continue to 
do it, even if my amendment passes. It just is the case that right now, 
there are safeguards. There has to be safeguards around a schedule I 
drug, and if this bill, without my amendment, is passed, the safeguards 
will be gone and that is the problem.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
amendment which strikes language that allows funds to go to 
universities researching cannabis. We should not be afraid of data and 
research. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, we should 
be encouraging expanding our knowledge--not limiting it.
  Politicians should not be stifling academic freedom.
  I am proud to represent California-13 which includes some of the best 
research institutes in the country, UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley 
Labs. None of us should want to withhold funds from our institutions 
and constituents because a university wants to do scientific research 
on a plant. UC Berkeley has one of the only cannabis research centers 
in the country and these prohibitions just tie the hands of our 
professors, researchers, and students by imposing restrictions on 
funding and essentially silencing them.
  I urge my colleagues to vote no against this anti-science amendment 
and to vote no against academic freedom.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it.
  Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


             Amendment No. 36 Offered by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
36 printed in part B of House Report 117-109.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 187, lines 11 through 22, strike section 507 of 
     division A.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I present this amendment at the desk 
today because for a very long period of time, the United States has and 
continues to uphold obsolete and old provisions from the war on drugs.
  This provision specifically has, for a very long period of time, 
prevented and acted as a barricade to Federal research on certain 
substances--such as psilocybin, MDMA, and marijuana--in allowing us to 
research the applications and potential therapeutic applications of 
these drugs in the treatment of diseases such as PTSD, addiction, and 
depression.
  We are long overdue and in a moment of reckoning to make sure that we 
not only rectify the harms from the past but allow us to research the 
potential medicinal applications of these substances. The first step in 
doing that is ending and taking down some of these old provisional 
barriers to research.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  We all know mental health is a major problem in our country. 
According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 50 
million Americans from all walks of life suffer from a mental health 
issue.
  One such population extremely close to my heart is veterans. With 
around 20 veteran and servicemember suicides per day, I consider one 
death to be too many. The amendment before us, however, is trying to 
solve a problem that, frankly, just doesn't exist.
  There is plenty of research already being conducted featuring the use 
of schedule I drugs to treat mental illness and addiction. The 
amendment will do nothing to change this, despite its claims to the 
contrary.
  What the amendment will actually do is repeal an existing provision 
that limits the use of funds to promote legalization of schedule I 
drugs. The amendment also repeals a provision that specifically allows 
Federal funds to be used to research the therapeutic uses of these 
substances.
  The stated purpose of this amendment, which is to support this 
research on behalf of those who suffer from critical diseases, is 
contradictory to the actual effect. Therefore, because of the 
disingenuous nature and intent of this amendment, I urge my colleagues 
to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1845

  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, briefly, I think one of the things 
that is important to acknowledge is that to have such a broad and vague 
provision in what qualifies as promotion, it includes research and, one 
could argue, primarily affects scientific research to prevent us from 
actually having the evidence to assess these substances for what they 
are.
  Currently, much of the research that is being conducted right now is 
reliant on private funding, or the stigma and fear and the chilling 
effect associated with having these provisions on the books, which are 
largely unnecessary, prevents such critical research from being funded.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Correa), my colleague.
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this 
measure, and I also have the veterans very near and dear to my heart.
  Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, I started my quest to help veterans deal 
with those invisible wounds that they bring back from the battlefield, 
PTSD and other mental issues that they bring back with them and carry 
with them on a day-to-day basis.
  As the chair of the California Committee on Veteran Affairs, I held 
hearings. I kept getting veterans saying: We prefer cannabis to opioid 
medication. We want the VA to give us cannabis. We don't want opioids.
  I soon discovered that there was no medical research anywhere to 
determine what cannabis was good for and what it was not good for.
  Today, as a Member of Congress, I have attempted to pass legislation 
year after year mandating that the VA do research, conduct research 
into the medical benefits of cannabis, and we scored zero.
  This amendment is simple. It is about saying let's do medical 
research into the benefits of cannabis and other drugs that our 
veterans are taking that they say are good for them. Let's not take 
away from our veterans the ability to have the medications they prefer.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure. Let's do it for our 
veterans. Let's do it for their welfare. Let's do it for scientific 
research.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please support this measure.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion and the articulate response of 
my colleague. I have had the honor to serve with him, and we agree on 
the vulnerability of veterans. In fact, a year-plus ago, we tried to 
move the IMPROVE Act through the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to try 
to look at different ways to provide opportunities to bring veterans 
into the VA healthcare system so we could identify them and treat their 
addiction. It wasn't necessarily about the research of the product. It 
was the research of the veteran as a whole, the veteran's 
vulnerability.
  Mr. Speaker, it was painful in the committee setting to have the 
IMPROVE Act disapproved when, at the same time, that same committee 
authorized equine therapy.

[[Page H4075]]

  As Dr. Phil Roe said at the time, this a first for the Committee on 
Veterans' Affairs. We have not allowed people to treat veterans, but we 
are allowing horses to treat veterans.
  The point is, we are looking to do something here via this amendment 
that does not solve an existing problem. We need to have the outreach, 
the research, but we also need to have the human side to make sure that 
we connect all the dots for the betterment of the veterans' mental 
health.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, with acknowledgment of that point, I think many of us 
have a shared outcome and a shared goal here, which is to help people 
who are hurting.
  Right now, more than 40,000 people die in the United States of opioid 
overdoses annually. At least one in two PTSD patients cannot tolerate 
or do not respond adequately to existing treatment. We have promising 
indications that certain drugs that, frankly, are unjustly, in my 
opinion, placed on a schedule I list have promising outcomes for people 
who are suffering from PTSD, including our veterans.
  We have to have the research in order to develop these holistic, 
whole person treatments. That research deserves to be in the realm of 
the public. That research deserves to be eligible for public funding. A 
blanket, vague ban that was borne out of fear and the paranoia of the 
war on drugs should not be defining the limits of our ability to act 
responsibly today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, the amendment before us, as it has been 
presented, is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist, as stated. 
There is ample research already being conducted featuring the use of 
schedule I drugs to treat mental illness and addiction. The amendment, 
as presented, will do nothing to change this, despite the claims to the 
contrary.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to not support or, said a different 
way, to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, to that point, I believe that this 
problem does very much exist. Much of the research that is being 
conducted today must rely on private funding, and we cannot allow for 
that to be limited in its scope.
  If we only allow corporations or if we only allow well-moneyed 
interests and wealthy interests to have a monopoly on the ability to 
research these drugs, we are not acting and really fully using the 
resources of the public in order to determine the full benefits that 
could be possible.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, as a veteran and one who served the country 
for 40-plus years in uniform, the bond we have as veterans goes deeper 
than anyone could imagine. The worst thing that can happen, as has 
happened in my family, is to have a loved one and a veteran take their 
own life. I have decades, unfortunately, of family experience in this. 
Because of that, my passion for stating opposition to this amendment 
goes unabated.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

  Modification to Amendments En Bloc No. 5 Offered by Ms. DeLauro of 
                              Connecticut

the form I have placed at the desk.

[[Page H4077]]

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The amendments are modified.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.
  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for 
yielding. I am just in awe of her virtuoso presentation of this 
legislation for the people.
  I thank the chairwoman for the mastery of the subject matter, for the 
strategic plan that she had to bring it to the floor, for her 
collaboration with her subcommittee chairs as well as the chairs of the 
subcommittees of authorization. I congratulate and thank her. I thank 
her for the children.
  Mr. Speaker, this package puts working families first. It does so by 
prioritizing jobs, laying the foundation to create hundreds of 
thousands of good-paying jobs, including by rebuilding the 
infrastructure, including surface transportation and water 
infrastructure to get the lead out; advancing the clean energy economy 
of the future; and launching workforce training for the 21st century. 
And it puts working families first by investing in our children.
  Again and again, when people ask me what the three most important 
issues facing the Congress are, I always say the same thing, our 
children, our children, our children, and their health; their 
education; the economic security of their families; a clean, safe 
environment in which they can thrive; a world at peace in which they 
can reach their fulfillment.
  This legislation addresses many of these priorities.
  Mr. Speaker, children's health is protected with child nutrition 
initiatives, including SNAP and WIC, serving tens of millions of hungry 
kids.

                              {time}  1900

  I remember when the stories were written about the first community 
health centers, the person who was the leader in all of that was 
spending some health money on food, and the Federal Government said: 
That is supposed to be for prescription drugs and not for food.
  He responded: Food is what makes our children healthy.
  So I thank the gentlewoman for the nutrition sections in here.
  The health of the family is also protected by support for public 
health initiatives for maternal and child health, as well as research 
to fight future pandemics and to head off future pandemics.
  Our children's education is advanced by ensuring that K-12 schools 
have resources they need, including with historic investments in title 
1, and higher education is advanced in Pell grants and other financial 
assistance and funding for minority-serving institutions, our HBCUs, 
our Hispanic-serving institutions, and our institutions that help our 
Native-American institutions of higher learning.
  I think it is really important to note--and I thank the chairwoman 
for recognizing this--that when we talk about the investments we make 
in an appropriations bill, it is important to note that this is not 
increasing the national debt--nothing.
  Mr. Speaker, economists will tell you nothing brings more money to 
the Treasury than the education of the American people. Earliest 
childhood, K-12, higher ed, post-grad, lifetime learning for our 
workers--nothing brings more money. So I thank the gentlewoman for this 
fiscally responsible initiative.
  In terms of the economic security of our children and families, these 
bills make strong investments in rental, homeowner, and other housing 
initiatives, including low-income households, and in combating 
homelessness, and they address economic disparities facing families.
  Indeed, this appropriation package puts justice and equity front and 
center. We are proud of its provisions to combat injustice and economic 
opportunities, pollution and the environment, health and more.
  This package is also about our children's future in another respect. 
It confronts the climate crisis by expanding environmental enforcement 
efforts, creating a Civilian Climate Corps and launching a renewed 
focus on protecting our cherished scenic places and expanding local 
parks in communities across the country for our families to enjoy. It 
sets us on a course for an affordable, secure, and clean energy future 
by investing over $14 billion in clean energy and science which will 
also create thousands of green jobs.
  Also, so importantly, this package honors our responsibility to our 
veterans, their families, and their caregivers. These bills contain 
robust funding for veterans' healthcare including women's health, women 
veterans' health, mental health, and homelessness assistance. It will 
help veterans transition to civilian life with economic opportunities 
worthy of their service.
  We always say that we owe so much to our men and women in uniform and 
to our veterans. We owe them so much to meet their needs, but we also 
owe them a debt of gratitude by building a future worthy of their 
sacrifice. This bill also builds vital military infrastructure, 
including military housing, childcare centers, and VA facilities.
  This week, as we advance these appropriations bills, Congress will 
continue our work to advance infrastructure and budget reconciliation 
bills that meet the needs of the American people separate from the 
appropriations bills. In all that we do, Democrats are for the people 
and building back better by investing in America with jobs, 
opportunity, and progress for families.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote for this important and impactful 
appropriations bill of which the Congress and the country can all be 
proud with great gratitude to Madam Chair, Congresswoman DeLauro, for 
her leadership and all the members of her team.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for a unanimous consent request.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of 
the amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Oklahoma?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Jackson).
  Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 4502, which would block the IRS from targeting people or groups 
based on their political beliefs.
  Unelected bureaucrats at the IRS have a history of weaponizing their 
power to go after conservatives. Mr. Speaker, you may recall the Lois 
Lerner scandal that happened during the Obama-Biden administration. In 
that case, the IRS targeted conservative groups by subjecting their 
application for tax-exempt status to increased and unnecessary 
scrutiny, effectively trying to silence their political beliefs.
  Now, as President Biden, Joe Biden, has made it clear, his 
administration will weaponize big tech to go after conservatives, too. 
There is a trend here, and Congress must act. People and organizations 
should not be silenced because of their political beliefs.
  If it can happen to conservatives, then it can happen to liberals 
too, so every Member in this body has a duty to protect their 
constituents from potential IRS abuse. My amendment would help make 
sure things like the Lois Lerner scandal never happen again at the IRS.

[[Page H4078]]

  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this 
commonsense amendment.
  Ms. DeLauro. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.
  Mr. Speaker, the amendments en bloc includes a number of proposals 
offered by Members on both sides of the aisle. It includes amendments 
offered by Democrats and Republicans, and several offered jointly by 
Members of both parties on which the vast majority of this body can 
agree.

  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan amendments en bloc, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).
  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment No. 151, which seeks to provide an additional $650,000 to 
the U.S. Geological Survey to accelerate updating the seismic hazard 
model for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The corresponding 
offset would come from a small portion of the increase to transition 
the U.S. Geological Survey fleet to zero emission vehicles, which falls 
under the same account.
  The National Seismic Hazard Model describes the potential impacts of 
earthquakes nationwide and serves as the basis for seismic provisions 
in building codes. While the U.S. Geological Survey office last updated 
the model for the 48 contiguous States in 2018, it has not updated the 
models for Alaska since 2007, for Hawaii since 1998, and for Puerto 
Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands since 2003.
  The U.S. Geological Survey has begun updating the models for Alaska 
and Hawaii, which will be released with the next update of the National 
Seismic Hazard Model in 2023. Unfortunately, there is not enough time 
to update the models for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. That 
is the reason this amendment will provide the initial funds needed to 
permit the U.S. Geological Survey to complete Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands update within 3 years, by 2024.
  In Puerto Rico we know firsthand the devastating impact earthquakes 
can have, as we saw last year in the southern part of the island where 
most of the schools were destroyed as well as infrastructure. Updating 
the hazard model is, therefore, urgent and crucial to saving lives and 
ensuring that we have the necessary tools to prepare for future seismic 
events.
  Mr. Speaker, that is the reason I urge my colleagues to support the 
amendment.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the en bloc package which 
includes my amendment, Langevin No. 129, to the Financial Services and 
General Government Division.
  I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Quigley of that 
subcommittee for his support of the amendment and my good friend and 
fellow Cyberspace Solarium Commissioner, Congressman   Mike Gallagher, 
for cosponsoring the amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a simple amendment. It increases funding for the 
Office of the National Cyber Director to $25 million, the full amount 
recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission which was created in 
last year's NDAA. Its charge was to create an overarching strategy to 
better protect the United States against cyberattacks of significant 
consequence.
  Creating the position of the National Cyber Director has been a 
passion of mine for more than a decade. It finally happened last year, 
and I have long argued that we need a head coach to coordinate all of 
the various cyber players in the Federal Government, and the NCD does 
just that.
  Chris Inglis, who started earlier this month, is the Nation's first 
Senate-confirmed National Cyber Director, and he is exactly the right 
person to ensure that we effectively implement a national cyber 
strategy to protect us from the ever-growing threats that we face in 
cyberspace.
  But, Mr. Speaker, he can't do his job without an office to support 
him. So this amendment will ensure that Director Inglis has the staff 
he needs to fulfill his statutory obligations to review agency cyber 
budgets, lead the development of cybersecurity policy, and coordinate 
incident response.
  So I appreciate, again, the support of Chairman Quigley and the 
overall Appropriations Committee led by Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro.
  Mr. Speaker, this is an important amendment, and I urge my colleagues 
to support the amendments en bloc and the underlying bill.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. Kahele).
  Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the appropriations chair, Ms. 
DeLauro, and Ranking Member Granger for their leadership in bringing 
these appropriations bills to the floor.
  I rise before you today, Mr. Speaker, to speak on behalf of my 
bipartisan amendment co-led by Representatives Ferguson, Davis, 
Fitzpatrick, and Bergman.
  For the last 10 years, some foreign airlines have sought to undermine 
international standards, the rights of U.S. workers, and to erode the 
competitiveness of our U.S. domestic airlines. These foreign airlines 
are unfairly using atypical business practices to register their 
airline away from its home country in more convenient locations to find 
countries with more permissive legal, regulatory, labor, and safety 
standards which creates a serious disadvantage for our U.S. workers and 
carriers, as well as undermines the safety standards the U.S. has 
worked so hard to cultivate.
  Commercial aviation contributes over 5 percent to the U.S. GDP and 
supports hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. My bipartisan 
amendment seeks to prevent flags of convenience airlines from 
undercutting U.S. jobs by ensuring that no Federal funds can be used to 
approve a new foreign air carrier permit unless certain conditions are 
met, including evaluating if it is in the best public interest.
  This commonsense amendment, Mr. Speaker, will enable the Department 
of Transportation to prevent foreign airlines that use atypical or 
flags of convenience business models from flying to and from the United 
States which will support American jobs, American workers, and the U.S. 
airline industry.

  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Speier).
  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Appropriations 
Committee whom I deeply adore.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment which highlights the 
Defense Department's abject failure to maintain its child development 
centers and its barracks and the need for a $15 billion investment.
  Our associates in the department and the generals all talk about how 
important it is to take care of the whole servicemember. I always say 
that when a servicemember serves, so does his or her family.
  Now, we know by their own admission that there are 135 childcare 
centers that are in either poor or failing condition, and we have more 
than 9,000 families with children on waiting lists in the military.
  But having all that knowledge, Mr. Speaker, you would think that they 
would elevate this issue. But only one childcare center has been 
considered in their budget request. There are 135 that are poor or 
failing, and they chose to only fund one.
  While the Army announced with great fanfare some time ago a $10 
billion, 10-year project to replace substandard barracks, that would 
require $1 billion a year in which they would invest in barracks, but 
they have only committed and requested $262 million--they are clearly, 
not on track to complete this $10 billion project over 10 years.

                              {time}  1915

  I thank the Appropriations Committee for adding $300 million for 
barracks and child care centers over the Department's request, but this 
does not excuse the military from its responsible. Talk is cheap. 
Action is what we want to see.
  Mr. Speaker, I call on the Department to do a better job in the next 
year's budget. I urge my colleagues to

[[Page H4079]]

include $15 billion for these quality of life matters for our military 
families in the forthcoming reconciliation package.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. Schrier).
  Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, wildfires in Washington State have been 
increasing in intensity and scale every year for the past few years, 
and our State and local fire departments are being called to respond 
like never before.
  Last year, Kittitas County, a county in my district, worked together 
with a neighboring district, closely together, to put out the Evans 
Creek fire. And both counties joined forces, they prevented tremendous 
damage, stopped the fire.
  However, only one county received Federal reimbursement money to help 
them pay the expenses; the other one is now left almost destitute 
having blown out their budget. So the money followed the county lines, 
not the fire lines.
  So my amendment ensures that small municipalities can get Federal 
reimbursement funds after fighting wildfires, regardless of where those 
county lines are. It will direct the Wildland Fire Leadership Council 
to provide recommendations on addressing interjurisdictional fire 
reimbursement challenges like this one and provide some clarity.
  As we face increasingly catastrophic wildfire seasons each year, 
stepping up to help a neighboring county should be encouraged. And a 
fairer distribution of Federal reimbursement distribution dollars would 
do just that.
  This is a commonsense amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support 
its adoption.
  For months, exporters in my district have struggled to get their 
crops overseas because foreign-owned carriers are taking empty 
containers back to China rather than waiting for our growers to load 
their crops. This is threatening decades-long trade relationships 
across the Pacific.
  These large multination corporations control all overseas 
transportation, and exporters really have no power. My amendment 
directs the Federal Maritime Commission to enhance assistance to U.S. 
exporters and importers both informally and affordably and without the 
need to hire lawyers.
  Getting U.S. goods to market in a timely fashion can affect the 
success of an entire growing season for farmers and for producers. This 
issue affects not just Washington State, it affects farmers across the 
country and the lack of shipping container availability is an issue at 
all U.S. ports.
  It is time to give exporters more support to ensure their goods can 
get to market in time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, we support the amendment and would 
encourage our colleagues to vote for it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I would just say I support the amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bipartisan 
amendment to Division E of H.R. 4502, offered with Congressmen Guy 
Reschenthaler and Vincente Gonzalez, number 183 and part of en bloc 
package number five, which would increase funds for the United States 
Geological Survey (USGS) by $2,000,000 and decrease funding for the 
Secretary of the Interior, Departmental Operations, by the same amount.
  Since my first term in Congress I have worked diligently to decrease 
our reliance on foreign sources of elements and minerals critical for 
certain energy applications. These materials are especially important 
for our clean energy future, used in products like electric vehicles 
and wind turbines among many others. Legislation I introduced on this 
subject, the Securing Energy Critical Elements and American Jobs Act, 
was the basis for a robust domestic research and development program on 
energy critical materials signed into law as Sections 7001 and 7002 of 
the Energy Act of 2020 (Division Z of the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260)).
  Sections 7001 and 7002 authorize a total of $208 million for this 
program in fiscal year 2022. Of that, $158 million is for Department of 
Energy (DOE) work. I want to thank the Energy and Water and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee for providing the needed funds and 
for citing to Sections 7001 and 7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 in its 
committee report when describing what DOE is to do in this area.
  The remainder, $50 million, essentially is for activities to be 
undertaken by or with the Department of Interior or USGS, and those 
activities are the subject of my amendment. I appreciate that the 
report from the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Subcommittee references and directs funds to some work 
on critical minerals. However, it does not refer to specifically to 
Section 7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 or mention all aspects of the 
program that section of law creates.
  My amendment thus serves two purposes. First, its passage is intended 
to reinforce congressional intent that the Department of Interior and 
USGS should use funds the bill gives to carry out all aspects Section 
7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 that are applicable to each and as 
directed by that law. This includes developing and publishing a list of 
critical minerals, coordinating with the Department of Energy to 
establish and operate a Critical Materials Information Portal, and 
working with the Department of Labor on a relevant workforce 
challenges.
  Second, my amendment adds $2,000,000 to the money USGS is already 
provided for efforts on critical minerals to improve its ability to do 
this vitally important work. This is the most that its budget could be 
increased in this area above what is already provided in the underlying 
bill within the confines of this appropriations legislation.
  I urge all Members to support my amendment.
  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of SCORE 
and stand in favor of the amendment I introduced with Rep. Spanberger 
to increase SCORE funding to $21.7 million.
  Simply put, this amendment would help build businesses and create 
jobs.
  SCORE is the nation's largest network of volunteer, expert business 
mentors, with more than 10,000 volunteers across 240+ chapters.
  They offer free and confidential advice, and free or low-cost 
educational workshops to current and aspiring small business owners.
  Since 1964, SCORE has helped more than 11 million entrepreneurs to 
start and grow their small business.
  In FY20, SCORE helped its clients to start 45,027 new businesses and 
create 74,535 new jobs.
  It is estimated that this increased funding would help SCORE create 
over 100,000 additional new businesses and/or jobs, beyond last year's 
impact numbers.
  Moreover, SCORE is cost-effective.
  In 2020, SCORE clients generated $67.35 in new federal tax revenue 
for every $1 appropriated to SCORE.
  The need is urgent. As we continue to recover from the COVID 
pandemic, we need to support entrepreneurs in building businesses and 
creating jobs. Our response must meet the moment.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 555, the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) and the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. Simpson) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds. The en bloc 
amendment includes a number of proposals offered by my Democratic 
colleagues. It reflects our shared values of investing in the American 
people to create good paying jobs, grow opportunities, and provide a 
lifeline to the vulnerable.
  I urge my colleagues to support the important proposals that are 
contained in this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy 
and I appreciate the work that has been done with the en bloc 
amendment, that is, adopted a proposal that I had to fully fund the 
$1.7 million in reoccurring annual appropriations to meet ongoing 
operations and maintenance of in-lieu fishing sites along the Columbia 
River.
  Mr. Speaker, these are areas that had been fished by Native people 
for a millennia. But with the construction of the dam projects, they 
were flooded out. There was an obligation on our part to be able to 
deal with these sites, some of which are used for year-round housing, 
and the conditions are appalling in terms of lack of sanitation, 
distressingly unset, not proper electricity, sewers, or water.
  I am pleased that we are starting to address this opportunity to be 
able to do right by these Native people. It is an obligation that is 
long overdue. If you look at it, it is appalling. These are conditions 
that one does not expect to see in the United States. These are people 
who have fished in this area for

[[Page H4081]]

generations. They deserve to have the Federal Government meet its long 
overdue obligations to restore those in-lieu fishing sites.
  I appreciate the committee putting my amendment in the en bloc, and I 
hope it will move forward so that we can finally square accounts with 
Native people in these historic sites.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. Strickland).
  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Appropriations 
Committee for her hard work.
  This is an opportunity for me to speak on behalf of my amendment 
concerning the toxic chemical from tires, yes, the tires on cars, 
trucks, and vehicles, that has a chemical that is killing coho salmon.
  I thank also Representatives Kilmer and Schrier for their support of 
this amendment and to the combined Washington State University and 
University of Washington research team for their work on this critical 
issue.
  Late last year, this team found that a toxic chemical called 6PPD-
quinone runs off roadways and into streams when it rains, entering the 
bloodstream of coho salmon and killing them.
  Salmon are fundamental to the Pacific northwest culture and 
especially for our Native American Tribes. David Troutt, the Director 
of National Resources for the Nisqually Indian Tribe has said, ``In 
1987, we were fishing 105 days a year. As of 2015, that number has 
reduced to 8 days a year, and if the coho population continues to 
decline, I am afraid 8 days will go down to no days, disconnecting our 
community from the place they have been for 10,000 years.''
  It is time for us to robustly fund research into this issue today. By 
supporting my amendment, we are sending a message, that Congress is 
committed to funding research at the scale to address it.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. Omar).
  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced four of the 
amendments in this en bloc.
  My first amendment would allow the Federal Government to start 
researching new economic metrics that would take into account the well-
being of American families in a way that our current GDP measure does 
not.
  The second amendment addresses challenges posed by COVID to 
remittances and how the Federal Government could better facilitate 
these lifelines for fragile countries.
  My T-HUD amendment makes sure the Federal Government is helping 
manufactured housing communities cope with the pandemic.
  And, lastly, my Interior amendment ensures that the NEA prioritizes 
grants for projects that preserve civil rights art, such as the 
projects within the George Floyd Memorial site in Minneapolis.

  Thank you to the Appropriations Committee for including these 
amendments that will help my district and many more.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House, and I thank him 
for his kind remarks in his earlier presentation.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I repeat my admiration for the chair and the 
work that she has done and the staff has done. I thank them very much.
  I might say that the ranking member, who is speaking on this bill, 
is, A, a dear friend of mine, and, very frankly, a gentleman who has 
added real quality to this institution and real collegiality to this 
institution. And I want you to know, Mr. Simpson, how much I appreciate 
your service in the House of Representatives. You are my friend and a 
great Member of the Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, the amendment that I have offered is a result of my 
sponsorship of the Help America Vote Act, in which I created a program 
that we called the Help America Vote Act. However, when we got to the 
end of the write-up of the bill, Bob Ney, who was the chairman of the 
House Administration Committee, at that point in time I was the ranking 
member, suggested that we use that phrase for the bill itself.
  However, originally, the Help America Vote Act was a program which 
would encourage colleges to have programs for their students so that 
they would work on election day in polling places. No generation knows 
these new electronic devices for voting better than the younger 
generation.
  And my thought was then, and is now, that we ought to encourage young 
people, knowing not only the partisan politics that go on, but how 
America runs its elections. So that is what I am trying to do here. I 
have been encouraging, and we have appropriated money in the past for 
this program.

                              {time}  1930

  I want to thank my friend from Illinois (Mr. Quigley), who is not on 
the floor, but a good friend of mine for his leadership on this 
subcommittee. I thank him and the rest of the subcommittee members for 
ensuring that the Financial Services and General Government 
Appropriations Act contains robust funding for the Election Assistance 
Commission. Bob Ney and I worked on creating that commission. It has 
relatively limited powers, but it is a very important ally of local 
election officials.
  This funding for the EAC is critical to ensuring secure elections for 
the American people. My amendment would take a portion of that funding, 
some $4 million, and use it for the purpose of supporting the Help 
America Vote Act College Poll Worker.
  This program has been a top priority for me for two decades. At a 
time when our elections are under stress from record turnout, the 
deployment of new technologies, and the realities of the pandemic, we 
need to recruit more young Americans to volunteer as nonpartisan poll 
workers.
  I think any of us who go to the polls--of course, all of us in this 
room go to polls on a regular basis--we see an aging coterie of poll 
workers. This would add, I think, a real component to the volunteers 
that are available to our local election boards.
  I know my election board has a tough time recruiting sometimes. You 
are there a 14-, 15-hour day, and it is not necessarily the most 
glamorous job in the world.
  Traditionally, many poll workers in this country are older Americans. 
We continue to benefit from their experience and expertise, of course. 
They have much to teach younger Americans about how best to staff 
polling places and oversee ballot counting. But with COVID-19, many 
have taken a step back and are looking to train the next generation in 
these skills.
  The HAVA College Poll Worker Program is a critical tool, in my view, 
in helping communities bring more young Americans into this public 
service. Very frankly, I expect them to go to their dorm or their 
neighborhood with their peers and say: Hey, I am going to work the 
polls. You ought to come down and see me.
  That would be a way to encourage younger people to get out and vote.
  As poll workers, young Americans will bring their energy, their 
enthusiasm, and their technology know-how to help our elections run 
smoothly. It will also instill a love of democracy and voting in a new 
generation of Americans who will see firsthand--and I am a big 
proponent of in-person voting. I am a big proponent of mail ballots as 
well, but I think going to the polls, seeing others there, seeing them 
exercise their democratic franchise is an exciting and, frankly, 
enriching experience.
  Last year, I met with the presidents of colleges throughout the 
University of Maryland system and worked with them to encourage 
students to sign up as poll workers and to have programs which may be 
either a half of a credit or part of a democracy course or a history 
course or some sort of social studies course saying: This is how we 
technically run elections, not partisan. This is how we just do it 
technically, how  Mike Simpson, Steny Hoyer, and Rosa DeLauro actually 
vote on election day.
  We don't know exactly how many more students volunteered in 2020 
because there isn't funding for tracking that data and coordinating 
these efforts. So, my concept is a college may

[[Page H4082]]

get a $20,000 grant to run a program for students on how to run an 
election. It may be 3 hours in 1 week or something, not a long course.
  With this program, more college students will have an opportunity to 
learn how to get involved as nonpartisan poll workers so they can step 
up and help make our country and our democracy stronger for years to 
come.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Quigley, Chair DeLauro, and Ranking Member 
Simpson for their help in this effort.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me mention the amendments that I 
have in en bloc No. 6. I will focus on a few of them.
  I have Nos. 157, 216, 220, 219, 218, 217, amendments that I think 
will make the legislation better but also help the American people and, 
certainly, focus on issues that are impacting my district. But these 
are universal matters that should be addressed.
  My amendment increases and decreases funding for the Environmental 
Programs and Management by $5 million to highlight the need to support 
culturally competent Federal, State, and local public health and 
environmental protection efforts to address cancer clusters impacting 
overburdened communities in the Gulf Coast region. That includes Fifth 
Ward and Kashmere Gardens, among others, in the northeast part of 
Houston which have suffered because of creosote contamination, 
Superfunds, railroads that have contaminated the soil. They have seen 
the seismic increase of cancer among families. It is going through 
generations. I have met these families, and they have had mothers, 
fathers, children, grandchildren have cancer and die of cancer. This is 
an important legislative amendment for me.
  Amendment No. 216, very quickly, deals with the reckless utilization 
of Federal dollars by the Texas Department of Transportation. We have, 
by our community, filed 106 complaints against them. This amendment 
indicates that you cannot put in place a transportation project that 
has not been determined to meet the statutory and fiduciary obligations 
of the National Historic Preservation Act. It pertains to I-45.
  In addition, we provide funding or focus on motorcycle, urban 
bicycle, and pedestrian safety. That is a challenge in the State of 
Texas, and we have had a lot of injuries because of the lack of 
sensitivity to that question.
  In addition, we have a housing amendment and other amendments that 
are very important to this legislation in my district.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of En Bloc Amendment No. 6 to Rules 
Committee Print 117-12, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 
157, and 216-220.
  I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and 
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Price for including them 
in this En Bloc Amendment.


                Division E--Interior and the Environment

  Jackson Lee Amendment #157 increases and decreases funding for 
Environmental Programs and Management by $5 million to highlight the 
need to support culturally competent federal, state, and local public 
health and environmental protection efforts to address cancer clusters

Federal Rail Administration Safety and Operation's account to emphasize 
the need to provide dedicated funding to address community engagement 
on safety issues related railroad crossings in urban areas.

address challenges faced by communities impacted by persistent poverty 
and are not included in decision making when major highway construction 
threatens their homes, businesses, and culturally significant 
structures.
  Jackson Lee Amendment #217 increases by $1,000,000 the Office of Fair 
Housing and Equal Opportunity to address the fairness in the use of 
Community Development Block Grant Disaster funding to repair or replace 
single family homes damaged during Hurricane Harvey to ensure that 
multigenerational homes can house the family at documented pre-disaster 
capacity.
  I urge all Members to vote En Bloc Amendment #6 and yield back my 
time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
Torres) now controls the time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).
  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules and 
Appropriations Committee for bringing my amendment to the floor.
  My amendment increases funding for the National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture Research and Education Activities account by $2 million by 
decreasing the Agriculture Building and Facilities account. I am 
pleased that my colleague,   Bobby Rush, co-leads this amendment with 
me.
  The goal of the amendment is to increase funding for the 
Multicultural Scholars Program designed to increase the diversity of 
the food and agricultural scientific and professional workforce.
  Currently, the Multicultural Scholars Program receives only about 
$945,000 a year. This level of funding is critically low, given the 
current racial/ethnicity gaps in food and agricultural sciences and 
given the fact that communities of color were disproportionately harmed 
by the dual economic and health crises in our country.
  For example, even though people of color represent nearly one-quarter 
of the U.S. population, farmers of color comprise less than 4 percent 
of owner-operators.
  Similarly, about 75 percent of registered dieticians and 
nutritionists are White. In contrast, only 4 percent of dieticians 
identify as Asian; 3.3 percent as Latinx; 2.5 percent identify as 
Black; 1 percent identify as Native Hawaiian-Pacific Islander; and 0.6 
percent identify as American Indian or Native Alaskan.
  My amendment is an important step to increasing grants to low-income 
minority students who attend colleges and universities that serve high 
percentages of individuals underrepresented in these fields.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the opportunity to present.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).
  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from 
California, the chair, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of this 
amendment.
  This would increase the funding for the San Francisco Bay restoration 
from $25 million to $30 million, a small sum in the scheme of things 
but huge in terms of its impact.
  Over the last 200 years, 90 percent of the San Francisco Bay wetlands 
have disappeared. If we don't act now, the damage will be irreversible 
by 2030.
  The San Francisco Bay estuary is the largest estuary west of the 
Mississippi, yet it has been shortchanged in terms of resources. 
Between 2008 and 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency invested 
only $45 million in the San Francisco Bay. Conversely, Puget Sound 
received $260 million and Chesapeake Bay $490 million. As you can see, 
it has been shortchanged.
  The funding wouldn't just benefit San Francisco. The bay supports 4 
million jobs, supplying drinking water for 25 million people, and 
provides irrigation for about one-half of the Nation's fruit and 
vegetable production.
  It is critical to all of us. We must invest now to save this 
ecological treasure.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close. I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
