     reimbursement of such taxes, and that can reasonably 
     accommodate such assistance in a programmatically responsible 
     manner.
       (e) Determinations.--
       (1) In general.--The provisions of this section shall not 
     apply to any foreign government or entity that assesses such

     arrangement that is providing substantial reimbursement of 
     such taxes; or

       (1) Bilateral agreement.--The term ``bilateral agreement''

     Government of the United States and the government of the 
     country receiving assistance that describes the privileges 
     and immunities applicable to United States foreign assistance

     between the Government of the United States and such 
     government that describes, among other things, the treatment 
     for tax purposes that will be accorded the United States 
     assistance provided under that agreement.
       (2) Taxes and taxation.--The term ``taxes and taxation'' 
     shall include value added taxes and customs duties but shall

     provision of this or any other Act:  Provided, That any such 
     reprogramming shall be subject to the regular notification 
     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations:  Provided 
     further, That assistance that is reprogrammed pursuant to

     Agency for International Development that are specifically 
     designated for particular programs or activities by this or 
     any other Act may be extended for an additional fiscal year 
     if the Secretary of State or the USAID Administrator, as 
     appropriate, determines and reports promptly to the 
     Committees on Appropriations that the termination of 
     assistance to a country or a significant change in 
     circumstances makes it unlikely that such designated funds 
     can be obligated during the original period of availability:  
     Provided, That such designated funds that continue to be 
     available for an additional fiscal year shall be obligated 
     only for the purpose of such designation.
       (c) Other Acts.--Ceilings and specifically designated

     Provided, That any such determination shall include a 
     detailed justification, and may be submitted in classified

     list of units prohibited from receiving such assistance 
     pursuant to section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
     1961 to the recipient government, and such assistance shall 
     be made available subject to a written agreement that the 
     recipient government will comply with such prohibition:  
     Provided, That such requirement regarding a written agreement 
     shall take effect not later than December 31, 2021.
       (8) Oversight and accountability.----

     the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2754) and that the 
     defense articles, services, and training procured with funds 
     appropriated under such heading are consistent with United 
     States national security policy.
       (B) The Secretary of State shall promptly inform the

     conditions as the Secretary of State may prescribe.
       (B) Cluster munitions.--No military assistance shall be 
     furnished for cluster munitions, no defense export license

                     arab league boycott of israel

       Sec. 7036.  It is the sense of the Congress that--
       (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary 
     boycott of American firms that have commercial ties with 
     Israel, is an impediment to peace in the region and to United 
     States investment and trade in the Middle East and North 
     Africa;
       (2) the Arab League boycott, which was regrettably 
     reinstated in 1997, should be immediately and publicly 
     terminated, and the Central Office for the Boycott of Israel 
     immediately disbanded;
       (3) all Arab League states should normalize relations with 
     their neighbor Israel;
       (4) the President and the Secretary of State should 
     continue to vigorously oppose the Arab League boycott of 
     Israel and find concrete steps to demonstrate that opposition 
     by, for example, taking into consideration the participation 
     of any recipient country in the boycott when determining to 
     sell weapons to said country; and
       (5) the President should report to Congress annually on 
     specific steps being taken by the United States to encourage 
     Arab League states to normalize their relations with Israel 
     to bring about the termination of the Arab League boycott of 
     Israel, including those to encourage allies and trading 
     partners of the United States to enact laws prohibiting 
     businesses from complying with the boycott and penalizing 
     businesses that do comply.

                         palestinian statehood

       Sec. 7037. (a) Limitation on Assistance.--None of the funds 
     appropriated under titles III through VI of this Act may be 
     provided to support a Palestinian state unless the Secretary 
     of State determines and certifies to the appropriate 
     congressional committees that--
       (1) the governing entity of a new Palestinian state--
       (A) has demonstrated a firm commitment to peaceful co-
     existence with the State of Israel; and
       (B) is taking appropriate measures to counter terrorism and 
     terrorist financing in the West Bank and Gaza, including the 
     dismantling of terrorist infrastructures, and is cooperating 
     with appropriate Israeli and other appropriate security 
     organizations; and
       (2) the Palestinian Authority (or the governing entity of a 
     new Palestinian state) is working with other countries in the 
     region to vigorously pursue efforts to establish a just, 
     lasting, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that will 
     enable Israel and an independent Palestinian state to exist 
     within the context of full and normal relationships, which 
     should include--
       (A) termination of all claims or states of belligerency;
       (B) respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, 
     territorial integrity, and political independence of every 
     state in the area through measures including the

     recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force;

     in the area; and
       (E) a framework for achieving a just settlement of the 
     refugee problem.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     the governing entity should enact a constitution assuring the 
     rule of law, an independent judiciary, and respect for human 
     rights for its citizens, and should enact other laws and 
     regulations assuring transparent and accountable governance.
       (c) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (a) if the 
     President determines that it is important to the national 
     security interest of the United States to do so.

     apply to assistance intended to help reform the Palestinian

     (a), consistent with the provisions of section 7040 of this 
     Act (``Limitation on Assistance for the Palestinian 
     Authority'').

     public health in any part of the world.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, is debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective 
designees.
  The gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.


                             General Leave

  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I am very proud, Mr. Speaker, to present the fiscal year 2022 State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill for the 
first time as chairwoman of this critically important subcommittee. 
Indeed, it is an honor to be entrusted with the responsibility of 
managing the SFOPS bill which has been a key component of United States 
foreign policy since World War II.
  The resources provided in this bill are based on the fundamental 
generosity of the American people, but they also protect and advance 
our national security, economic prosperity, and global leadership. I 
commend the Biden-Harris administration and our chair, Rosa DeLauro, 
for recognizing the importance of the State and Foreign Operations 
budget, and I urge my colleagues to follow suit by supporting this 
bill.
  With unprecedented levels of human suffering and so many complicated 
challenges around the world, the bill rightfully increases funding for 
global health and the prevention of future pandemics and for migration, 
refugee, and disaster assistance, and continues our support for key 
allies and partner organizations such as the United Nations. These are 
just a few of many ways the SFOPS bill meets urgent humanitarian needs, 
many of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
  The COVID pandemic has caused significant economic and social harm. 
That is why the development investments in this bill are especially 
crucial as we strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 
2030, including eliminating extreme poverty, achieving an AIDS-free 
generation, and supporting efforts to build inclusive, equitable, and 
accountable societies for everyone.
  Now, let me address directly some of the questions I have heard about 
what the SFOPS bill does and does not include.
  To my friends who focus, as I do, on women's global health, the 
fiscal year 2022 SFOPS bill substantially increases funding for 
bilateral family planning for the first time in a decade to $760 
million, which is an $185 million increase over last year. It also more 
than doubles our contribution to UNFPA to $70 million, which we know 
was completely cut off and politically scapegoated during the previous 
administration.
  Just as important, the bill does not include previous years' policy 
riders like the harmful Helms amendment and the global gag rule which 
only served to undercut our programs' effectiveness and ability to 
provide women, especially women of color, around the world with 
comprehensive healthcare.
  To our friends committed to fighting the climate crisis, this year's 
SFOPS bill provides a $1.6 billion contribution to the Green Climate 
Fund, which is the first direct appropriation that this House has 
provided for the fund. Along with an additional $1.4 billion for our 
other environmental programs, this bill invests $3 billion to combat 
the climate crisis which will help ensure that the United States 
resumes its leadership in this global fight and work in partnership 
with other countries.
  To my friends who have requested increased funding for our own 
hemisphere, this year's bill includes a 25 percent increase for the 
Caribbean, including $10 million in new funding for projects in the 
Caribbean to promote inclusive economic growth.

[[Page H4141]]

  The bill also includes $350 million more than last year for 
assistance to Central America, which is urgently needed in the Northern 
Triangle, to address the root causes of migration and to help combat 
corruption and impunity which are so endemic among local government 
officials. We all have met and are haunted by the experiences that 
migrants have conveyed to us despite all the odds about their dangerous 
journey across Mexico. We must do better so that the United States 
border is not their last and best hope for survival. That is why the 
House bill makes targeted investments in local communities through 
trusted NGOs while holding national governments accountable.
  The bill also provides critical support for vulnerable communities in 
Africa and upholds our abiding commitments to the security of our 
allies, such as Israel, Jordan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Many of our 
partners continue to struggle with growing economic challenges at home 
resulting from conflicts in their region, migration, and the impact of 
COVID-19.
  The SFOPS bill and report make clear our support for a two-state 
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and we have increased 
assistance to the Palestinian people by $150 million over last year's 
bill and eased the burdensome requirements on the administration's 
ability to contribute to UNRWA.
  Crucially, and of great importance to me, the bill also helps ensure 
that our Nation's diplomatic and development workforce reflects the 
diversity of the American people by increasing funding and providing 
authority and guidance to equip the Secretary of State and USAID 
administrator to make meaningful progress in increasing diversity and 
inclusion in the Nation's international affairs workforce.
  Lastly, to my friends who passionately advocate for human rights, 
democracy, and the rule of law, I share your goals and your values. The 
SFOPS bill may not solve all of the world's problems, but it certainly 
makes new and significant gains on many different fronts. We include 
new oversight and accountability requirements on our security 
assistance which will better align such aid with our national security 
policy before it is provided, and we provide support to civil society 
leaders around the world who are making their communities and societies 
more equitable and inclusive.
  We also include $18 million for the Tibetan people. I especially want 
to thank our Speaker and good friend, Chairman McGovern, for their work 
on this issue.
  I have many more examples, but my time is limited. I will conclude by 
urging my colleagues to consider the very positive and considerable 
progress we have made in this year's SFOPS bill in reversing the 
devastating consequences from the last administration's foreign policy 
failures. Restoring American credibility and leadership on the world 
stage is no easy task, but this bill makes unequivocal commitments to 
diplomacy and development in addition to improving the lives and 
livelihoods of millions of people around the world.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask your support of the SFOPS bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

                              {time}  1415

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  I rise in opposition to the bill. At the outset, though, I want to 
congratulate our subcommittee chair on shepherding her very first bill 
to the House floor. The bill before us provides $62.2 billion for the 
Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. That is 
a 12 percent increase, Mr. Speaker, over the fiscal year 2021 enacted 
level.
  The bill provides important funding for our national security, 
including $3.3 billion for Israel. The recent conflict between Israel 
and Hamas, and the looming shadow of Hezbollah and Iran, remind us all 
of the threats Israel faces to its security every day.
  The fighting in Gaza stopped when it did, in part, due to the 
diplomatic efforts of Egypt. As Secretary of State Blinken told the 
committee, Egypt was vital to helping arrange the cease-fire and 
remains an essential partner for the United States in the region--
Egypt.
  While the bill maintains funding for Egypt at the current level, I 
strongly disagree with the additional conditions that this bill places 
on Egypt.
  The bill continues critical funding for Jordan, supports countries 
facing Russian aggression, and provides resources to meet our 
commitments in the Indo-Pacific, including $300 million for the 
Countering Chinese Influence Fund.
  The bill provides funding for Colombia, our good ally and friend, at 
last year's level. This is a critical moment for that country, and we 
should be doing all we can to support them. However, I regret that new 
conditions that this bill places could undermine our counternarcotics 
efforts, which are critical in Colombia.
  Our programs there are in our own self-interest, especially given the 
amount of cocaine that still floods American streets and causes so much 
destruction in our communities back home.
  Another drug problem sowing chaos back home is the opioid epidemic. 
The bill includes new language that directs the State Department to 
expand their current efforts to tackle the opioid crisis and better 
address this terrible problem.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish I could stop there and say this is a good bill. 
Unfortunately, the spending increases outside of these critical areas 
are just too great, and the policy riders are too extreme.
  First and foremost are changes made to the longstanding measures that 
protect the sanctity of life. These are commonsense provisions that 
have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades. Of greatest concern is the 
removal of the most important condition in any State-Foreign Operations 
bill, that no funds can be used to pay for abortion. The removal of 
that language is unprecedented, but it doesn't stop there.
  The bill also includes a permanent prohibition of the Mexico City 
policy, weakens the Kemp-Kasten restrictions on coercive abortion, and 
increases funding to the U.N., among many other controversial changes.
  Another tough pill for the American taxpayer to swallow is the more 
than $3 billion included in this bill for environmental programs that 
bring a high potential for duplication, wasteful complexity, and 
substantial oversight challenges.
  The bill also increases funding for the United Nations and other 
international organizations while ignoring the need for long-overdue 
and desperately needed reforms.
  The absence of conditions on the World Health Organization is 
particularly concerning, given what we all know about their complicity 
in covering up the COVID-19 outbreak.
  Despite some areas of agreement, the unrestrained spending and 
unprecedented partisan riders require that I oppose this legislation. 
I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), our very distinguished 
chair who serves for the first time this year as the chair of the 
Appropriations Committee and has done a phenomenal job in helping us 
get this bill to the floor.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. With both of us, 
this is a maiden voyage, so it is wonderful to be with her. I thank her 
for the work that she has done.
  I thank our ranking member as well for the work on this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, the past 4 years have seriously eroded our Nation's 
position in the world. Under President Trump, our government was more 
disruptive than constructive and more absent than present on the world 
stage. This has been especially true in the midst of the worst public 
health and economic crisis in a generation.
  President Biden has made it clear that America is back. The State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs funding bill puts those words 
into action. It makes America stronger at home and respected again in 
the world. It restores American leadership by responding to global 
health threats, including the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. It 
addresses urgent humanitarian needs while confronting the climate 
crisis.
  As we speak, the global pandemic is far from over. Around the world, 
we are still seeing over 400,000 new cases per

[[Page H4142]]

day and over 8,000 deaths. To confront this continuing crisis, this 
bill invests in global health and the prevention of future pandemics 
with $10.6 billion to support the health of families and global 
communities, including $1 billion in global health security to bolster 
the public health surveillance, detection, and response capabilities of 
countries around the world.
  Given the global economic devastation wrought by the pandemic, this 
bill provides $8.5 billion to meet urgent humanitarian needs. It 
empowers women to build a brighter future for their families and 
communities by providing $760 million for family planning and $70 
million for the United Nations Population Fund while repealing the 
restrictions that make it more difficult for women across the world to 
access safe and legal abortions.

  Finally, this bill prepares us for the existential threat of climate 
change. It provides more than $3 billion to address the climate crisis 
and other environmental programs, including $1.6 billion for the Green 
Climate Fund.
  With this bill, we are proving that America is back and ready to 
confront the biggest challenges facing our Nation and the world.
  I thank Chairwoman Lee for her work, and I urge support for the bill.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), the ranking member of the 
Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
4373, the fiscal year 2022 State-Foreign Operations appropriations 
bill.
  This bill has many fatal flaws, in spite of Republican efforts to 
improve it. The concerns raised during markup were not addressed, and 
many of the amendments we offered at the Rules Committee have not been 
made in order on the floor today.
  I will begin with our list of major complaints. To put it simply, the 
spending level is too high, and the policies are too controversial.
  This bill alone includes a 12 percent increase over current levels, 
with $3 billion directed into climate change programs like the Green 
Climate Fund. For the sake of generations to come, we can't afford to 
spend like this.
  In addition to these unrealistic spending levels, the majority has 
made policy decisions that will complicate any attempts to come to a 
bipartisan agreement.
  Most concerning, this bill includes alarming changes to longstanding 
language to protect the unborn. Language that prohibits foreign aid 
from being used to pay for abortions was dropped entirely.
  The bill also includes other controversial changes, such as a 
permanent repeal of the Mexico City policy, which prohibits 
organizations who receive foreign assistance from performing abortions.
  As the former chair of this subcommittee, I am very disappointed to 
see lifesaving global health activities put in jeopardy because of 
partisan politics. We must develop top-line spending levels that both 
sides can support, and we must agree to drop controversial policy 
provisions.
  If we want to avoid a long-term continuing resolution or, worse, a 
government shutdown, we must get serious and do the work our 
constituents sent us here to do. I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this bill.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my good friend.
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding, and I congratulate the gentlewoman on presenting her first 
bill as a cardinal on the Appropriations Committee. This is a long time 
coming, and it is a pleasure to work with her.
  The bill invests in health and upholds American global values abroad.
  The fiscal year 2022 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, in 
a historic move, removes the Helms amendment, which has prohibited safe 
abortions and healthcare services for poor and vulnerable women in low-
income countries for decades. That is a significant decision and one 
that enables access to healthcare for millions of women across the 
globe.
  I am pleased that this bill includes language to support countries, 
like Colombia, who have welcomed Venezuelans fleeing the humanitarian 
crisis. It also funds prodemocracy and human rights programs in 
Venezuela, as well as in Cuba. This funding is critical to ensure 
access to broadcasting and the internet in Cuba. These platforms will 
provide support to the Cuban people as they struggle for freedom and 
true self-governance.
  Finally, this bill continues support for the critical U.S.-Israel 
partnership by fully funding U.S. security assistance to Israel and 
cooperative missile defense programs. Ensuring that Israel maintains 
her qualitative military edge is essential for stability in the Middle 
East and our own national security.
  I truly thank Chairwoman Lee for working closely with me and others 
on this bill.
  As we always say in the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Speaker, the 
spending decisions that we make are an expression of our values. This 
bill telegraphs that expression of our values, of America's values, and 
the strengths that we have, at the same time providing us the ability 
to provide assistance to millions of vulnerable people across the 
globe. I am proud to support it and to work with Chairwoman Lee going 
forward so we can see it become law.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, by executive order, President 
Biden reversed the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, 
which was a reiteration and expansion of President Ronald Reagan's 
Mexico City policy. Announced by Ronald Reagan at a U.N. conference on 
population growth in Mexico City in 1984, hence its name, the policy 
was designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer money was not funneled to 
foreign, nongovernmental organizations that perform or promote 
abortion.
  My amendment, which was not made in order, would have inserted new 
text that reinstates the Mexico City policy which was rendered 
inoperative by the President, and it also would have taken out new pro-
abortion language that says that no President in the future can 
promulgate any iteration of the Mexico City policy.

                              {time}  1430

  The Mexico City policy established pro-life safeguards; benign, 
humane conditions on global health assistance. For years, foreign 
nongovernmental organizations have been subsided and empowered by 
taxpayer funds--and let's not forget, this is grant money--to weaken, 
undermine, or reverse pro-life laws in other nations, especially in 
Africa, and to destroy the precious lives of unborn children.
  The Mexico City policy mitigates U.S. taxpayer complicity in global 
abortion and underscores our deep commitment to protecting the weak and 
most vulnerable.
  According to a recent Marist poll, 77 percent of Americans are 
opposed to using tax moneys to pay for abortions in other countries. 
Only 19 percent support it.
  The Marist poll found that 55 percent of Democrats, 85 percent of 
Independents, and 95 percent of Republicans were against using taxpayer 
funds to pay for abortions in other countries.
  U.S. foreign assistance, Mr. Speaker, and foreign entities that we 
fund with billions of dollars of grant money should consistently 
affirm, care for, and tangibly assist women and all children--all 
children, including unborn babies--regardless of their age or condition 
of dependency.
  Second, Mr. Speaker, since 1973, the Helms amendment has prohibited 
using taxpayer funds to directly pay for abortions in other countries. 
Helms is the Hyde amendment for the rest of the world. The bill before 
us today, however, completely reverses the Helms amendment.
  I had offered in Rules a second amendment that would have reinstated 
Helms. It was not made in order.
  Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for child dismemberment, 
including severing arms and legs and actual decapitation of the baby 
with sharp knives, or deadly poisons or drugs like RU-486, which 
starves the baby to death.
  Children alive but not yet born who are killed by abortion after 20 
weeks or later experience excruciating suffering and pain. And until 
they are rendered

[[Page H4143]]

unconscious or dead by these hideous procedures, the baby feels the 
pain of every cut.
  Years ago, Senator Biden said, and he wrote to constituents, that 
opposition to abortion funding would: ``Protect both the woman and her 
unborn child.''
  He said: ``Those of us who are opposed to abortion''--again this is 
Joe Biden--``should not be compelled to pay for them.''
  Finally, my amendment on the U.N. Population Fund was not made in 
order, as my good friend and colleague Harold Rogers had said, this 
legislation weakens the Kemp-Kasten language significantly.
  I would point out to my colleagues--because I offered the first 
amendment on this floor back in 1984 on the complicity of the U.N. 
Population Fund in forced abortion and forced sterilization in China. 
For over four decades, the U.N. Population Fund has vigorously 
supported, funded, defended, promoted, even celebrated the Chinese 
Communist Party's coercive population control program.
  I met with the head of the Chinese program, Peng Peiyun, back in 1991 
in Beijing, almost a 3-hour meeting.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, Peng Peiyun told me over and 
over again, there is no coercion in the Chinese program, even though 
everyone who has followed it knows that there is, because she said the 
UNFPA was there, on the ground whitewashing and falsifying the truth.
  We are missing maybe 60 million females, women of all ages now, 
because it has been a systematic extermination of the girl child in 
China. It is one of the reasons why human sex trafficking has exploded 
in China, because the girl child has been killed, exterminated, and the 
UNFPA has been at best silent on that issue, again, giving the Chinese 
Communist Party a clean bill of health.
  Doubling the amount of money that was in previous bills from $35 
million to $70 million while simultaneously weakening Kemp-Kasten 
trivializes these crimes against women and these crimes against 
children.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to respond to 
the gentleman from New Jersey and read a section of this bill.
  It says: ``None of the funds made available in this Act nor any 
unobligated balances from prior appropriations Acts may be made 
available to any organization or program which, as determined by the 
President of the United States, directly supports or participates in 
the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary 
sterilization: Provided, That any determination made pursuant to this 
paragraph must be made not later than 6 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, and must be accompanied by the evidence and 
criteria utilized to make the determination: Provided further, That 
none of the funds made available under this Act may be used to lobby 
for or against abortion.''
  Finally, I will just say that Hart Research recently conducted a poll 
of Americans across the political spectrum and found that over 60 
percent of the American public supports reproductive freedom for women.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California 
(Mrs. Torres), who serves as a very valued member of the State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee and has had tremendous 
input into this bill.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
legislation, and I thank Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairwoman Lee for 
their hard work and support of the priorities that I have included in 
this bill as it relates to the Central American region.
  We must ensure our aid to Central America helps the people it is 
intended to help and advance our policy goals, including reducing 
migration.
  My Republican colleagues yesterday noted that what we have done in 
the past is not working and has not worked, and I agree with them 100 
percent.
  The Trump administration turned a blind eye to corruption in the 
region and emboldened predatory, corrupt government officials.
  For the last 4 years, we effectively looked at the symptoms and not 
at the systematic failures that forced the region's most vulnerable 
asset, their young people, to flee to our border.
  So if Guatemalan President Giammattei truly does believe in the rule 
of law, he should show us with his actions. Recently, they have fired 
Francisco Sandoval. He needs to be reinstated. The Guatemalan people in 
Guatemala deserve a judicial sector and leaders with his credibility to 
advance his cases of corruption.
  I am so glad to report that my priorities in this bill include 
restricting 75 percent of the funding that has gone to all three 
governments--El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala--to ensure that the 
money is actually reaching the people that it is intended.
  Furthermore, we have never in the past restricted or put conditions 
on funding to their attorney general's office. In this bill, we have 
included an amendment that restricts all funding to the attorney 
general.
  Our goal here is to reduce migration and to ensure that the young 
people in the region can see a future for themselves and take their 
governments back.
  Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I thank our brand new congresswoman 
and her staff for the hard work that she has put before us in this 
committee.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).
  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again stand for life 
and to prevent American taxpayers from paying for abortion services 
overseas. Americans should never be forced to fund abortions against 
their conscience, period.
  I have long supported the Hyde amendment, which prohibits taxpayer 
funding from paying for abortions domestically. Yesterday, I proudly 
spoke in support of this key pro-life protection, which the Democrats 
stripped from these appropriations packages.
  Now, Democrats are trying to force Americans to foot the bill for 
abortions abroad. For decades, the Helms amendment has prohibited 
abortion services from being included in our Nation's foreign aid.
  Driven by a radical agenda, Democrats and the Biden administration 
have removed this longstanding, commonsense prohibition from the State 
and Foreign Operations bill on the floor today.
  To make it clear, congressional Democrats and the Biden 
administration are trying to force the American taxpayer to fund 
abortions in foreign nations.
  The facts are on our side. Seventy-seven percent of Americans oppose 
using taxpayer dollars for this purpose. It is deeply disappointing, 
but not surprising, that Democrats are continuing to attack our pro-
life values and Americans' fundamental conscience rights.
  Taxpayers in Indiana and around the country should never be forced to 
bankroll abortion services here at home, and we most certainly should 
not be forced to bankroll abortions abroad.
  This is a dangerous path of destruction. I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the bill.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip.
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bill, 
but I specifically want to talk about a provision that is being gutted 
that for decades has been bipartisan, Mr. Speaker, that is the Hyde 
amendment.
  Back in the 1970s, when Henry Hyde came to Congress from Illinois, 
one of his main objectives was to protect life. He started on a quest 
to do that on a number of different fronts, and he ultimately found a 
bipartisan consensus put into law back in 1976 to say that no taxpayer 
funds should be used for abortion. It was actually something that 
Republicans and Democrats rallied around.
  Since that time, every appropriations bill that has moved through 
Congress, for over 40 years, has included Hyde protections, until 
today.
  This is a sad day when you see how the Democratic Party has changed 
from the party back then.

[[Page H4144]]

  I want to read a quote, Mr. Speaker. This is from 1994. A prominent 
United States Senator said: ``Those of us who are opposed to abortion 
should not be compelled to pay for them.''
  You know who said that? Joe Biden said that, Mr. Speaker.
  Where is that Joe Biden today? Where is that Democratic Party today 
that has changed and moved so far away from those principles that were 
bipartisan? By the way, most Americans today, including many people who 
consider themselves pro-choice, think it is wrong to use taxpayer funds 
for abortion. Yet, this bill guts that decades-long tradition.
  Again, I will read from Joe Biden himself. ``Those of us who are 
opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them.''
  Why would we be abandoning that decades-long tradition that is also 
held by most Americans across this country?
  Not only, Mr. Speaker, are they gutting Hyde protections in this 
bill, they actually put millions of taxpayer dollars in this bill to 
fund Planned Parenthood facilities. So that is how far the party of old 
on the Democrat side has gone, to this Democrat socialist party that 
now supports taxpayer funding of abortion, including directly to the 
largest provider of abortions in America.
  This must stop. We will fight to stop the gutting of the Hyde 
amendment and the break from this bipartisan tradition.
  Before this process is over, let's get back to those principles that 
unite most Americans and should unite all of us in Congress, that no 
taxpayer funds should go to provide for abortions.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1445

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, this needs to be clarified for 
all Members who are listening.
  The Kemp-Kasten language--is and has been--the law and has been 
supported in a bipartisan way for years, because we are so unalterably 
opposed to coercive population control. It says that we will not 
support any organization that supports or comanages a coercive 
population control program. The new language takes out ``supports and 
comanages'' and puts direct, ``directly involved with abortion.''
  China is an absolutely closed society. It is run by a dictatorship 
under Xi Jinping. I have chaired 72 congressional hearings over the 
years on human rights in China, and many witnesses were women who have 
been forcibly abducted. Usually only the ones that escape and get here 
and become asylees and get asylum by our law here in the United States 
can speak out about it.
  So how will you ever ascertain if it is ``direct'' because Xi Jinping 
is not going to let you in to investigate. We can't even get answers on 
Wuhan, and this is even more closed than that, quite frankly.
  I do hope Members will realize this is a gutting of the Kemp-Kasten 
language. No matter how you feel about population control, we should be 
absolutely opposed to coercion. Nobody should be forced.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I urge a rejection of the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  First of all, let me just say, in responding to Mr. Smith, it is 
really long overdue to stop partisan attempts to scapegoat and score 
political points over UNFPA.
  The fact remains that UNFPA vigorously opposes any and all coercive 
practices and only supports access to safe and voluntary family 
planning. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply false.
  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the resources and programs in this 
bill which provide us the unique opportunity to restore America's 
global leadership that has been missing in recent years.
  Together we can address the greatest challenges facing the United 
States and provide vital support to the world's most vulnerable people.
  I want to take a minute to just thank our staffs on both sides of the 
aisle. As a former staffer, I know how these bills get put together, 
the length of time that they put in, and the real forthright and 
straight-up honest negotiations, given our differences. I think the 
bill is a very good bipartisan bill, and I think it is, in many 
respects, due to our staffs' relationships and their respect for each 
other.
  I specifically want to mention Craig Higgins and Erin Kolodjeski, 
Jason Wheelock, Jean Kwon, Marin Stein, Clelia Alvarado, Lacy Kilraine, 
Greg Adams, of course, in my office and Julie Nickson, Susan Adams, 
Jamie McCormick, John Muscolini, and all of the members of our staffs 
that haven't been mentioned, because I know a heck of a lot goes into 
this in terms of our support staff day and night and for their 
diligence and their brilliance and their respect for the process.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3473. I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. McHenry. Mr. Speaker, this year's State/Foreign Operations 
appropriations bill includes hundreds of billions of dollars in IMF 
giveaways to China, Russia, and state sponsors of terrorism. It's an 
abomination that the spending bill which funds our foreign policy 
priorities writes massive checks for America's adversaries.
  Under this legislation, the Treasury Department would be required to 
support an allocation of more than one-and-a half trillion Special 
Drawing Rights (SDR)--trillion with a T. These SDRs represent no-
strings-attached liquidity that will be lavished on some of the worst 
regimes in the world.
  The Democrats' bill would send over $140 billion in hard currency to 
the Chinese government to use as it wishes. Russia would get its hands 
on nearly $60 billion. State sponsors of terrorism like Iran and Syria 
would find themselves with more than $17 billion in support that they 
can use to kill civilians and destabilize the world, while Venezuela 
and Belarus would receive billions more.
  Like last year, House Democrats have included these dollars for 
dictators in the base text of this bill so that it can't be struck. 
They're so ashamed of financing America's adversaries that they don't 
want to require their Members' votes on this issue to be public. 
Perhaps they suspect that their Members don't want billions in hard 
currency going to the Chinese Communist Party, Vladimir Putin, and the 
ayatollahs.
  There are responsible ways to help the world address the COVID-19 
pandemic without showering billions on genocidal regimes and other 
human rights abusers--this is not it.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Each further amendment printed in part D of House Report 117-110 not

         Amendment No. 36 Offered by Mrs. Torres of California

       Page 224, beginning line 10, strike ``, including offices 
     of Attorneys General''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from Kentucky 
(Mr. Rogers) each will control 10 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendments 
en bloc No. 1 and yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Let me just thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for these 
amendments. Now I would like to yield to the gentleman from Kentucky 
(Mr. Rogers), our ranking member. I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I claim time in support of the 
amendments, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  This amendments en bloc contains a number of good proposals by both 
sides of the aisle. I want to highlight just a few.
  It includes language offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
Hill) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) to increase funding 
for the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. 
This will help ensure that this office has resources we need to ensure 
that U.S. citizens unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad receive 
priority attention from our government.
  It also includes a provision supported by the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany) that is in support of our close friend and 
partner Taiwan. At a time when the Chinese Communist Party has Taiwan 
in its crosshairs, we need to do all we can to support our democratic 
friends on that island. I, therefore, urge Members to support the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, my amendment, amendment No. 5, seeks to 
draw attention to the need to resolve the significant delays in 
passport services at the Department of State.
  The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on international travel. 
According to the Department of State's Passport Services, Americans who 
submit new passport applications today may not receive their new 
passports for another 18 weeks, well into the fall.
  Even customers who pay an additional fee for expedited service may 
not receive their passports for another 12 weeks.
  In response, the State Department's Passport Services recommends 
Americans planning to travel internationally apply for a passport at 
least 6 months in advance.
  These delays are simply unacceptable.
  In North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District, my constituents 
have been unable to travel to visit family, to seek important medical 
care, and to conduct important business meetings.
  It is essential that Congress send the message loud and clear. We 
must have better service on passports. We need to address passport 
delays so that Americans can get their passports in a timely manner.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, my amendment, which is included in this en 
bloc, would prohibit the use of any funds to create, procure, or 
display any map which depicts Taiwan as part of the People's Republic 
of China.
  This is a commonsense measure. As we all know, Taiwan has never been 
part of Communist China.
  The Taiwanese people elect their own leaders, raise their own Armed 
Forces, conduct their own foreign policy, and maintain their own 
international trade agreements.
  By every measure, Taiwan is a sovereign, democratic, and independent 
country. Any claims to the contrary are simply false.
  Since the 1970s, America's so-called One China policy has 
acknowledged Beijing's bogus argument that Taiwan is part of Communist 
China.
  This is a dishonest policy, and it is one that America should 
abandon.
  While we cannot end this policy with my amendment today, we can at 
least require honest maps that stop perpetuating the One China lie.
  Communist China is Communist China, Mr. Speaker, and Taiwan is 
Taiwan. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).
  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of my amendment 
demanding action in response to the Havana syndrome incidents affecting 
Americans around the world.
  The recent string of mysterious attacks on U.S. diplomats and 
personnel, often called Havana syndrome, is a serious threat to our 
national security.

[[Page H4146]]

Having spoken directly with individuals impacted, I know these attacks 
are having lasting and detrimental impacts on the health of our 
Nation's public servants.
  I stand here today to call for a robust, interagency response, one 
that reflects the severity and urgency of the situation.
  The State Department must play an active role in this response, share 
relevant information with Congress, particularly the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, and make sure all affected personnel receive prompt 
and appropriate care. It is our duty to ensure our public servants get 
the care and answers they deserve.
  As a former Federal employee, I intend to keep pressing the 
administration to better protect our diplomats and Federal employees 
serving at home and abroad.
  I know firsthand their commitment to their missions, their devotion 
to our country, and the promises we have made to them.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in this cause.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).

  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to 
highlight the urgent humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.
  We have taken action with the ALLIES legislation to make sure that 
the persons who have assisted us as drivers and interpreters find a 
pathway to freedom, but conditions for others are quite trying at this 
time.
  Conditions for women, civil society, journalists, human rights 
defenders, and others continue to deteriorate, with vulnerable Afghans 
facing threats of violence and death, and heightened restrictions in 
Taliban-controlled areas.
  Many Afghans are so terrified for their lives and their children's 
safety that they will not leave their homes. A recent wave of targeted 
slayings, more than 700 killed and 540 wounded in 2020, represents a 45 
percent increase from 2019. The number of women killed doubled between 
2012 and 2020.
  The withdrawal of U.S. troops and the raging expansion of Taliban 
territorial offenses in our wake requires urgent action. Our failure to 
help those who help us and those who are in the crosshairs of the 
Taliban would, frankly, make us complicit in any further bloodshed.
  That is why I have introduced this amendment, and I am introducing 
today the Improving Access for Afghan Refugees Act, to provide 
vulnerable Afghans with priority 2 refugee status to expand access to 
our refugee system.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill because we do 
have a moral obligation to do so.

                              {time}  1500

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I urge support of the 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I reiterate my support for the 
amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this En Bloc 
Amendment to H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations 
Act for FY2022, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 15, 16, 
and 17.
  I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and 
State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee Chair DeLauro 
for including them in this En Bloc Amendment.
  Jackson Lee Amendments No. 15 and No. 16 have been approved several 
times by the relevant subcommittee, made in order by the Rules 
Committee, and adopted by the full House; Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17, 
while being offered for the first time, makes a very important 
contribution to the health and safety of the global community.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 will designate $1,000,000 to combat the 
trafficking of endangered species.
  The amendment makes a good bill better by providing a $1 million 
focus to combat the transportation of the remains of endangered 
species, to confront the transport of the remains of killed endangered 
species.
  The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being lured off a 
protected preserve was an indication that we needed to do more to 
protect endangered species at risk of being killed.
  At that time, I introduced and sought the support of my colleagues as 
original cosponsors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endangered and 
Threatened Species Act of 2015.
  This bill sought to strengthen partner countries' capacity in , 
countering wildlife trafficking and designating major wildlife 
countries for protection.
  The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is again offered in the same spirit: 
to prohibit the taking and transportation of any endangered and 
threatened species as a trophy to the United States.
  Currently, the Endangered Species Act does not protect most wildlife 
animals killed. At this point, we can choose to make wise decisions 
that will sustain the global population, or we can ignore the warning 
signs.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is one that the House has strongly 
supported in the past because it would bring greater awareness and 
protection to these beautiful and vital populations that are too often 
taken for granted, by allowing this amendment to address the senseless 
trafficking in trophy killings of all endangered and threatened 
species.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 provides funds to be allocated for 
Global Health Programs to the fight against the practice of Female 
Genital Mutilation.
  I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long 
while, working closely with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York 
to introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this 
ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.
  Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures 
that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, 
or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.
  This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to 
other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as 
child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the 
human rights of women and girls.
  Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women 
alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger 
representing 44 million of those who have been cut.
  For example, consider that around the world, at least five girls are 
mutilated/cut every hour and more than 3 million girls are estimated to 
be at risk of FGM/C, annually.
  The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can 
include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during 
childbirth and death.
  Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C 
include the high concentration in specific regions associated with 
several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.
  According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the 
world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and 
Asia.
  Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S. 
bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of 
combatting FGM/C abroad.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 prioritizes funding for foreign 
assistance to combat Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an 
internationally recognized violation of the human rights of girls and 
women comes to an end.
  Finally, I thank the Rules Committee for making in order, and 
Chairwoman Lee for including in this En Bloc Amendment, Jackson Lee 
Amendment No. 17, which increases and decreases the Global Health 
Programs fund by $1,000,000 to emphasize the national commitment for 
USAID to provide unused vaccines that would otherwise be destroyed to 
countries in need around the world.
  Increasing the availability to those countries in need of superfluous 
but life-saving vaccines is what a great nation does; not only is it 
the right thing to do, but it also builds goodwill and rebuilds 
important global relations that were ruptured by the previous 
Administration.
  With the spread of Covid-19 variants on the rise, Jackson Lee 
Amendment No. 17 will help our neighbors in this hemisphere, and our 
friends and allies around the world cope with this ongoing global 
public health crisis.
  I urge all members to vote for the En Bloc Amendment and the 
underlying legislation, H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations 
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022.
  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, my amendment will direct $4,000,000 within 
the International Border and Water Commission to clarify the 
responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the International 
Outfall Interceptor (IOI). This is in addition to, and separate from, 
the funding that currently exists for the long overdue repairs to the 
IOI.
  The International Outfall Interceptor is the infrastructure that 
transports wastewater from Sonora, Mexico and Arizona to the Nogales 
International Wastewater Treatment Plant.
  The IOI pipeline covers approximately 8.5 miles. Under a 1944 water 
utilization treaty,

[[Page H4147]]

Mexico can treat water in the United States. The International Border 
and Water Commission is tasked with managing international 
infrastructure negotiations and operates the Nogales International 
Sanitation Project.
  On average, 92 percent of the water treated daily at the Nogales 
International Wastewater Treatment Plant is from Mexico and 8 percent 
from the surrounding community.
  Unfortunately, due to damage and aging infrastructure, the 
International Outfall Interceptor needs costly and urgent repairs. 
Wastewater constantly emerges from the IOI and pollutes surrounding 
rivers and streams. Rains carry the polluted stormwater into Nogales, 
Arizona and exposes downstream populations to extraordinary public 
health risk.
  In 2017, I called on the Governor of Arizona to commence the Disaster 
Declaration process for the State of Arizona to secure immediate 
federal assistance to remedy and prevent raw sewage exposure to Arizona 
residents.
  Every year during the monsoon season the health of residents along 
the Arizona southern border are put at risk, due to this ongoing issue. 
While Arizona residents are very familiar with this issue, other 
communities along the United States--Mexico border experience similar 
health risks due to similar issues.
  The IBWC recently awarded a contract to initiate the urgent repairs 
of more than 5 miles of the deteriorating pipeline using existing funds 
from the $34.2 million IBWC has already allocated. My amendment further 
directs $4,000,000 within the International Border and Water Commission 
to clarify the responsibility to sustain the operations and maintenance 
of the International Outfall Interceptor (IOI).
  This has been an ongoing international issue that impacts the safety 
and well-being of communities across Southern Arizona. In the past, 
Senators and Member of Congress on both sides of the aisle of the 
Arizona delegation have collaborated to remedy the situation.
  I would like to thank the Chairwoman and the committee for their work 
on this bill. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this amendment, 
and I would urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. We must 
finally find a solution to protect the health of residents along the 
United States--Mexico border.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Blunt Rochester). Pursuant to House 
Resolution 567, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en 
bloc offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

       Page 14, beginning on line 3, strike the colon and all that 
     follows through line 12 and insert a period.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from Kentucky 
(Mr. Rogers) each will control 10 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
amendments en bloc No. 2, and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  This amendment includes changes to the bill that I believe would be 
counterproductive, and I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I rise in support of the amendments en bloc. Madam 
Speaker, the amendments en bloc before us includes seven amendments 
that would significantly improve the quality of this bill.
  It includes an amendment that would prohibit funding to the U.N. 
Population Fund and strike funding for family planning and reproductive 
health. I am gravely concerned about the longstanding pro-life 
provisions that were stripped from the bill this fiscal year, all of 
them. Allowing the bill to proceed without protections for the unborn, 
like those in this amendment, is unprecedented and a direct hit to the 
sanctity of life around the world.
  Also included in this en bloc is an amendment that would prohibit 
contributions to various climate organizations, such as the Green 
Climate Fund. The underlying bill provides over $3 billion for climate 
change programs, including nearly $2 billion for ill-advised 
contributions to international climate funds. At a time when American 
families continue to struggle to make ends meet and foreign aid is 
under great scrutiny, proposing such politically motivated misuses of 
taxpayer funding adds insult to injury.
  The en bloc also includes an amendment that would prohibit funds for 
U.S. membership and/or contributions to the World Health Organization. 
The underlying bill, as currently written, includes no reforms of the 
WHO, even though they are complicit in covering up the COVID-19 
pandemic. Without necessary safeguards in place to improve WHO 
transparency, American taxpayer funds should not be used for this 
organization.
  Similarly, the amendments en bloc includes a proposal to reduce 
funding for the Contributions to International Organizations account. 
The base bill includes an increase for international organizations, but 
without conditions or requirements for reform, this is simply too much 
funding.
  The amendments included in this amendment give the bill a far greater 
chance of being signed into law. It includes longstanding pro-life 
provisions that enjoy support from the majority of the American public 
and commonsense safeguards to ensure taxpayer dollars are used in the 
most efficient manner.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support for the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.


                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members to refrain from 
trafficking the well while other Members are under recognition.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).
  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee 
for yielding and for her great work on this bill. Madam Speaker, all I 
can start with saying is my, my, my. It is not enough that Republicans 
are trying to block safe, legal abortions in every nook and cranny on 
Earth, now they want to defund the world's finest health agency and cut 
funding for family planning.
  For those who don't follow it, the UNFPA is the United Nations' 
sexual and reproductive health agency. Here is what it does: It 
supports reproductive healthcare for women and youth in

[[Page H4148]]

more than 150 countries, home to more than 80 percent of the world's 
population; it supports the health of pregnant women as well as 
reliable access to modern contraceptives and the training of thousands 
of healthcare workers; it supports the prevention of gender-based 
violence, including the abandonment of female genital mutilation; and 
it supports the prevention of teen pregnancy complications and efforts 
to end child marriage.
  I want to make it very clear, UNFPA has never supported forced 
abortions anywhere. Where I have heard that, it is a lie.
  This en bloc also seeks to cut family planning. Are you kidding? 
Really?
  You are trying to stop abortions, and then my friends on the other 
side of the aisle think you are going to stop it by stopping access to 
contraception and blocking the work of healthcare providers who deliver 
reproductive care? To me that is just crazy, Madam Speaker. Crazy, 
crazy, crazy.
  Madam Speaker, I have said this before, and I say this again, for 
women and their families to be safe, for communities to be prosperous, 
for the world to be peaceful, women must succeed. And that means they 
have to be healthy, free from sexual violence, and free to make their 
own personal decisions about whether and when to become a parent.
  I oppose the amendments en bloc, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Tony Gonzales).
  Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to 
include the text of my amendment in the Record immediately prior to the 
vote on the motion to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Madam Speaker, as you know, our ally 
Israel was forced to defend itself in May from Hamas and the 
Palestinian Islamic jihad, who over the course of 11 days 
indiscriminately fired over 4,000 rockets from Gaza into Israel.

  My motion to recommit would provide $1 billion to Israel to replenish 
and maintain its Iron Dome defense system.
  We must continue to stand with our ally Israel. We must continue to 
show that the United States believes in the right to existence and 
defend themselves. We must do everything within our power to ensure 
they are equipped to defend against these heinous attacks and defeat 
these terrorists.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jacobs).
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose my 
colleague Congresswoman Claudia Tenney's amendment No. 34, which would 
maintain the arbitrary 25 percent cap on U.S. contributions to U.N. 
peacekeeping operations.
  I recently introduced legislation, the U.S. Commitment to 
Peacekeeping Act that would, among other things, permanently repeal 
this cap and ensure that the United States is fulfilling its 
commitments to the United Nations.
  As someone who used to work at the U.N. Department of Peace 
Operations, I know firsthand how the cap and resulting arrears have 
harmed our interests. It damages our standing and credibility at the 
U.N. making it difficult to effectively advocate for human rights.
  It reduces our ability to conduct proper oversight and accountability 
through needed reforms, something my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle agree is important.
  It also impairs peacekeeping missions' ability to operate and delays 
funding to peacekeepers.
  All of this makes it harder for the United States to advocate for and 
secure its interests. In order to fully lead on the global stage, we 
need to fully commit to our international obligations.
  Tenney amendment No. 34 is counterproductive. I oppose it in the 
strongest terms, and urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting these 
efforts to weaken our standing at the U.N. and around the world.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Barbara Lee and her 
team for putting together such a robust State-Foreign Operations bill.
  I think this was a major achievement.
  I come here as the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian 
Issues, and I am extremely pleased to see $50 million in assistance to 
help bolster Armenia's ongoing democratic and economic transformations.
  This unprecedented commitment in funding will go a long way in 
helping continue economic governance and rule of law reforms while 
further strengthening America's strategic partnership with this young 
democracy.
  The language included in this bill also helps address the 
humanitarian needs in Artsakh as a result of the 44-day war perpetrated 
by Azerbaijan and Turkey last fall and directs an additional $2 million 
for demining programs.
  I also thank Chairman McGovern for his steadfast commitment to the 
Armenian people and share my appreciation for the cosponsors of my 
amendment, which will pass as part of this package.
  This amendment prevents U.S. security funding to Azerbaijan through 
the International Military Education and Training, IMET, and Foreign 
Military Financing, FMF, programs, which is sorely needed to combat 
Azerbaijan's aggression in the region.
  Let me be clear, Madam Speaker, this bill sends a clear signal that 
we will not aid or tolerate authoritarian regimes that threaten peace 
and security, especially when those actions are aimed at a fellow 
democracy.
  Again, I thank Chairwoman Lee. I know she has been a supporter of the 
Armenian people for many years. I have been to her district to see some 
of the Armenian Americans who really love her.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1515

  Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. One of the reasons that I oppose this amendment is because it 
proposes to eliminate all funding for family planning.
  Now, a woman's ability to thrive is dependent on her health and 
participation in society. The House bill we are considering will 
improve her opportunities.
  Let me review what countless studies have already shown: reproductive 
health services prevent unintended pregnancies, maternal deaths, and 
abortions; reduce rates of infant and child mortality; empower women to 
stay in school and join the workforce; create stronger and healthier 
families; and improve economies.
  But as we sit here today, more than 200 million women around the 
world still lack access to modern contraceptives. If we want to build 
on the self-reliance of countries, one of the most cost-effective 
measures is to increase access to family planning.
  Attacks on women's health must stop.
  Now, to oppose family planning and contraceptives and birth control, 
then to oppose abortions, that doesn't make any sense. Of course, my 
colleague from Florida said it very clearly, that it is just downright 
crazy.
  Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this en bloc amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from Kentucky 
(Mr. Rogers) each will control 10 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendments en bloc No. 3. Let me 
first thank my colleagues for raising these important issues.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. Jacobs).
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this en 
bloc package and thank the gentlewoman for including my amendment 
today.
  Madam Speaker, before coming to Congress, I served at the State 
Department working on countering and preventing violent extremism and 
addressing the real drivers behind it. What we know is that it is not 
possible to solely rely on security assistance and military tools to 
counter violent extremism. In fact, one of the common drivers of local 
recruitment into these extremist groups is abuses by state security 
forces.
  When the United States provides security assistance to militaries 
tasked with countering violent groups, we need to acknowledge the 
possible consequences and ensure that the assistance we do provide is 
not going to people who will abuse their own citizens and, in turn, 
exacerbate the very problem we are seeking to address in the first 
place. We need to properly allocate resources to actually address the 
drivers of violence and conflict, which means more funding to efforts 
like the Global Fragility Act.
  Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on these 
efforts.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition 
to the amendment, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, this amendments en bloc contains several measures that 
could have enjoyed broad support. Unfortunately, it also includes 
several amendments that some on our side are unable to accept. One is 
by the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar), which would transfer 
funds from foreign military financing to the development assistance 
account.
  At a time when the United States is facing serious national security 
challenges around the globe, including from China and Russia, we should 
be increasing U.S. security assistance rather than holding it flat or, 
worse yet, reducing it to increase an account that this bill already 
increases by 15 percent.
  We simply face too many challenges to be cutting national security 
funding at this time.
  Madam Speaker, finally, I also need to mention the self-executing 
manager's amendment offered by our distinguished subcommittee chair 
relating to the expansion of global currency reserves by the 
International Monetary Fund. This amendment would require the Secretary 
of the Treasury to support the issuance of an additional $2.1 trillion 
of special drawing rights, an IMF reserve asset, to all member 
countries of the fund. This is in addition to a whopping $650 billion 
that was already issued earlier this year.
  This is a highly controversial proposal that appears to run counter 
to other administration policies, including claims of prioritizing 
efforts to counter the maligned influence of Russia and China.
  This plan could result in many billions in additional reserves being 
sent to the world's most notorious dictatorships and state sponsors of 
terror, such as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.
  Not only does this unwise scheme go against the stated goals and 
objectives of the White House, but it also could hinder Treasury's 
efforts to penalize and pressure these malign state actors through 
extensive U.S. sanction regimes.
  Why go to all the trouble of putting in place and enforcing these 
sanctions when this proposal for the IMF to issue trillions in 
additional liquidity could significantly undercut years of pressure 
carefully designed to advance our national interest?
  Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendments en bloc, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from 
California for the time.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment in order to increase 
and decrease funds in the State Department to highlight the need for 
stronger congressional oversight, robust human rights measures, and 
transparency in U.S. arms sales to countries.
  The fact of the matter is, despite leaky laws in place, the United 
States has quietly trained and armed actors who eventually engage in 
human rights abuses all over the world through a State Department 
program known as direct commercial sales.
  This program allows the State Department to sell up to $100 to $300 
million in military training, weapons, and services without so much as 
notifying Congress.
  It was through this policy that the U.S. provided paramilitary 
training to Saudi operatives that later went on to kill Jamal 
Khashoggi, as well as for the sales of arms later used in the abduction 
and killing of more than 300 Colombians in the May 2021 protests over 
labor rights.
  The U.S. must stop arming and funding human rights violators. We must 
have stronger congressional oversight, robust human rights standards, 
and transparency in all U.S. arms sales.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I would like to talk about this bill 
overall, as well as potential amendments to the bill.

[[Page H4150]]

  Above all, this time around, after the massive increase of spending 
due to COVID, I think we ought to look as to whether this budget is 
frugal and whether the increases in the budget are actually necessary.

  I am going to address the line in the budget for international 
organizations, contributions to international organizations. The bill, 
as proposed on the floor today, is a 10 percent increase over last 
year. A lot of that money is going to the United Nations, a body that 
seems to delight in being critical of the United States and a body in 
which the clear majority of members operate governments in which you 
would not want to live there at all, human rights abuses and otherwise.
  In any event, I think we should go back to the last en bloc. There is 
an amendment in there. Rather than increase the amount to these 
international organizations by 10 percent, decrease the amount by 10 
percent.
  We are putting so much pressure on the value of the dollar, so much 
debt on our children and grandchildren.
  The idea of going back, not to a draconian level, but the idea of 
going back to somewhere between where we were in 2019 and 2020, not a 
radical number, I think would be prudent.
  I think, in this line as well as other lines of the budget, we should 
be looking to hold things about even or a mild step back, not another 
massive 10 percent increase, which will largely fund an organization 
that takes delight in making fun of the United States and the freedoms 
that we have.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).
  Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished subcommittee 
chair for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the en bloc, which includes my 
important amendment highlighting the United States' continued enabling 
of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition's ongoing blockade of Yemen.
  The war in Yemen is now in its sixth year, and it is clear that there 
is no military solution to the conflict.
  While the Biden administration announced earlier this year that it 
would limit U.S. involvement in the conflict, it has never been 
authorized by Congress, and more needs to be done.
  This begins by pushing for an end to the Saudi blockade of Yemen, 
which has exacerbated what continues to be the world's worst 
humanitarian crisis, with at least 400,000 Yemeni children facing 
starvation and potential death.
  The blockade limits delivery of food, fuel, and other critical 
supplies to the Yemeni people. This is unconscionable when Yemen is 
already facing the devastation of civil war and an ongoing public 
health crisis caused by COVID.
  Madam Speaker, we have to do better. I encourage my colleagues to 
support this en bloc to send a message that the blockade of Yemen needs 
to end.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).
  Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California 
for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment, which affirms 
President Biden's budget request of $2 million for the purposes of 
supporting the planning for the 2025 World Expo in Osaka, Japan.
  My amendment sheds light on a win-win situation for both our country 
and my home State of Minnesota.
  When I took my oath of office 2\1/2\ years ago, my team and I set out 
on an ambitious goal to visit every city and town in Minnesota's Third 
District within the first 6 months of my service to listen and learn 
from the local leaders who know our community best because I believe 
representation begins with listening.
  In the city of Bloomington, home of the famous Mall of America, we 
learned that city leaders were determined to bring the eyes of the 
world to Minnesota by bidding for host city of the 2027 World Expo, and 
there is good news. I am proud to share with you that Bloomington was 
selected as the United States' designee to compete on the world stage 
for hosting rights.
  Bloomington, the Twin Cities metro area, the State of Minnesota, and 
the United States will benefit from showcasing American innovation on 
the world stage. With the funds highlighted in this amendment, we will 
ensure that Bloomington has the financial support it needs to put the 
full strength of American ingenuity on display.
  I want to take a moment to thank the city of Bloomington, Global 
Minnesota, and the entire Minnesota delegation for supporting efforts 
like these. This is how democracy should work, Democrats and 
Republicans in Congress working together with constituents and 
government agencies to craft legislation to benefit localities and our 
entire country.
  Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with the Biden 
administration, just as we did with the Trump administration, to bring 
the World Expo home to Minnesota.

                              {time}  1530

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, for more than 2 weeks, we have seen 
the horrors of repression taking place on the island of Cuba by the 
communist regime.
  Let me tell you, I am outraged that the Democratic majority refused 
to make in order two amendments, bipartisan amendments, which I 
cosponsored, that were led by two of my Democratic colleagues who, by 
the way, are passionate about the cause of a free Cuba and the freedom 
of the Cuban people.
  The Murphy amendment would have provided an additional $7.5 million 
in democratic assistance to support the free flow of information to the 
island in this moment.
  The Sires amendment would have provided an additional $15 million to 
USAGM for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, at a time when the Cuban 
people had their internet cut.
  They are struggling with this incredible oppression: getting 
murdered, getting killed, getting dragged out of their homes. The fact 
that we are inadequately funding radio broadcasting to the island is 
hard to accept and hard to believe. It is disgraceful.
  Now, while the Cuban people are risking everything for freedom, the 
Democrat majority refused to allow these amendments to even be debated 
here on the floor of the House.
  I want to thank the Republican leadership and our Conference for 
their steadfast support for years for the cause of a free Cuban.
  But I want to thank those Democratic colleagues who are true 
defenders of freedom in the cause of the Cuban people: Representatives 
Murphy, Wasserman Schultz, and Sires, who fought hard to try to get 
these amendments here on the floor.
  As I stated in full committee, it is unconscionable that in this 
moment when the Cubans are doing everything they can, and they have hit 
the streets and they are getting bludgeoned and murdered and 
imprisoned, that this majority would not even allow those amendments to 
be heard on the floor of the House.
  Madam Speaker, history will remember those who stood with the cause 
of freedom, freedom for the Cuban people, and those who aligned 
themselves with the oppressive murderous regime that represses them now 
and for more than 62 years.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).
  Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her leadership 
and for including my amendment in the en bloc.
  Madam Speaker, as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I travel 
around the world and hear so many of our diplomats emphasize the 
importance of balancing development, diplomacy, and defense. But in so 
many places, I don't see that balance.
  My amendment is about restoring balance to our foreign policy by 
moving away from military assistance and arms sales and toward 
development and addressing the root causes of conflict.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, first of all, let me just say I am very proud of the 
resources and programs in this bill,

[[Page H4151]]

which provide us the unique opportunity to restore America's global 
leadership that has been missing in recent years.
  Together, we can address the greatest challenges facing the United 
States and provide vital support to the world's most vulnerable people.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments en 
bloc and the underlying bill.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this En Bloc 
Amendment to H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations 
Act for FY2022, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 15, 16, 
and 17.
  I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order and 
State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee Chair DeLauro 
for including them in this En Bloc Amendment.
  Jackson Lee Amendments No. 15 and No. 16 have been approved several 
times by the relevant subcommittee, made in order by the Rules 
Committee, and adopted by the full House; Jackson Lee Amendment #17, 
while being offered for the first time, makes a very important 
contribution to the health and safety of the global community.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 will designate $1,000,000 to combat the 
trafficking of endangered species.
  The amendment makes a good bill better by providing a $1 million 
focus to combat the transportation of the remains of endangered 
species, to confront the transport of the remains of killed endangered 
species.
  The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being lured off a 
protected preserve was an indication that we needed to do more to 
protect endangered species at risk of being killed.
  At that time, I introduced and sought the support of my colleagues as 
original cosponsors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endangered and 
Threatened Species Act of 2015.
  This bill sought to strengthen partner countries' capacity in 
countering wildlife trafficking and designating major wildlife 
countries for protection.
  The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is again offered in the same spirit: 
to prohibit the taking and transportation of any endangered and 
threatened species as a trophy to the United States.
  Currently, the Endangered Species Act does not protect most wildlife 
animals killed. At this point, we can choose to make wise decisions 
that will sustain the global population, or we can ignore the warning 
signs.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is one that the House has strongly 
supported in the past because it would bring greater awareness and 
protection to these beautiful and vital populations that are too often 
taken for granted, by allowing this amendment to address the senseless 
trafficking in trophy killings of all endangered and threatened 
species.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 provides funds to be allocate funds 
provided for Global Health Programs to the fight against the practice 
of Female Genital Mutilation.
  I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long 
while, working closely with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York 
to introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this 
ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.
  Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures 
that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, 
or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.
  This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to 
other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as 
child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the 
human rights of women and girls.
  Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women 
alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger 
representing 44 million of those who have been cut.
  For example, consider that around the world, at least five girls are 
mutilated/cut every hour and more than 3 million girls are estimated to 
be at risk of FGM/C, annually.
  The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can 
include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during 
childbirth and death.
  Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C 
include the high concentration in specific regions associated with 
several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.
  According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the 
world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and 
Asia.
  Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S. 
bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of 
combatting FGM/C abroad.
  Jackson Lee Amendment #15 prioritizes funding for foreign assistance 
to combat Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally 
recognized violation of the human rights of girls and women comes to an 
end.
  Finally, I thank the Rules Committee for making in order, and 
Chairwoman Lee for including in this En Bloc Amendment, Jackson Lee 
Amendment No. 17, which increases and decreases the Global Health 
Programs fund by $1,000,000 to emphasize the national commitment for 
USAID provide unused vaccines that would otherwise be destroyed to 
countries in need around the world.
  Increasing the availability to those countries in need of superfluous 
but life-saving vaccines is what a great nation does; not only is the 
right thing to do, but it also builds goodwill and rebuilds important 
global relations that were ruptured by the previous Administration.
  With the spread of Covid-19 variants on the rise, Jackson Lee 
Amendment No. 17 will help our neighbors in this hemisphere, and our 
friends and allies around the world cope with this ongoing global 
public health crisis.
  I urge all members to vote for the En Bloc Amendment and the 
underlying legislation, H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations 
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 567, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.
  Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of H.R. 
4373 is postponed.
