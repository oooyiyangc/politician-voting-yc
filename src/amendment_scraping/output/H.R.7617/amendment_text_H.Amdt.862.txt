     more.
       Sec. 308.  None of the funds made available by this Act or 
     any other Act making appropriations for energy and water 
     development and related agencies for any fiscal year may be 
     used to conduct, or make specific preparations for, any 
     explosive nuclear weapons test that produces any yield.

       (iii) how enrollment in such course of study will impact 
     the period of eligibility for Federal Pell Grants for such an 
     individual, including in a case in which the individual is 
     transferred to another facility or released before the 
     completion of such course;
       (iv) the transferability of credits earned, and the 
     acceptability of such credits toward a certificate or degree 
     program offered by the institution;
       (v) the process for continuing postsecondary education--

     such institution).
       (B) In the case of an institution that offers a program to 
     prepare incarcerated individuals for gainful employment in a

     which the course of study prepares students, including such 
     restrictions--

       (II) in the laws of the State in which the facility 
     involved is located and each State in which such individuals 
     permanently reside.
       (c) In this section:
       (1) The term ``facility'' means--
       (A) a place used for the confinement of individuals 
     convicted of a criminal offense that is owned by, or under 
     contract to, the Bureau of Prisons, a State, or a unit of 
     local government: or
       (B) a facility to which an individual subject to 
     involuntary civil confinement is committed.

     which a course of study of the institution is offered to 
     incarcerated individuals.

     incarcerated individual.
       (d) This section shall be in effect until titles I, II, 
     III, IV and V of the HEA are reauthorized.
       Sec. 316.  None of the funds appropriated by this title for

     shall be eligible to apply for funds made available under 
     paragraph (3) of such heading.
       Sec. 212.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in 
     fiscal year 2021, in managing and disposing of any 
     multifamily property that is owned or has a mortgage held by 
     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and during 
     the process of foreclosure on any property with a contract 
     for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United 
     States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) or any other 
     Federal programs, the Secretary shall maintain any rental 
     assistance payments under section 8 of the United States 
     Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are attached to 
     any dwelling units in the property. To the extent the 
     Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants and 
     the local government that such a multifamily property owned 
     or having a mortgage held by the Secretary is not feasible 
     for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
     or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
     rehabilitating and operating the property and all available 
     Federal, State, and local resources, including rent 
     adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted 
     Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (``MAHRAA'') (42 
     U.S.C. 1437f note), and (2) environmental conditions that 
     cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary 
     may, in consultation with the tenants of that property, 
     contract for project-based rental assistance payments with an 
     owner or owners of other existing housing properties, or 
     provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall also 
     take appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts 
     remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the 
     exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist 
     relocation of tenants for imminent major threats to health 
     and safety after written notice to and informed consent of 
     the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, 
     such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition 
     of any multifamily property described in this section, the 
     contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall 
     be subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.
       Sec. 213.  Public housing agencies that own and operate 400 
     or fewer public housing units may elect to be exempt from any 
     asset management requirement imposed by the Secretary in 
     connection with the operating fund rule:  Provided, That an 
     agency seeking a discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy 
     under the operating fund formula shall not be exempt from 
     asset management requirements.
       Sec. 214.  With respect to the use of amounts provided in 
     this Act and in future Acts for the operation, capital 
     improvement, and management of public housing as authorized 
     by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of the United States Housing Act of 
     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d),(e)), the Secretary shall not impose 
     any requirement or guideline relating to asset management 
     that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital funds 
     for central office costs pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of 
     section 9(g) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 
     U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)):  Provided, That a public housing 
     agency may not use capital funds authorized under section 
     9(d) for activities that are eligible under section 9(e) for 
     assistance with amounts from the operating fund in excess of 
     the amounts permitted under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 
     9(g).
       Sec. 215.  No official or employee of the Department of 
     Housing and Urban Development shall be designated as an 
     allotment holder unless the Office of the Chief Financial 
     Officer has determined that such allotment holder has 
     implemented an adequate system of funds control and has 
     received training in funds control procedures and directives. 
     The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a 
     trained allotment holder for each HUD appropriation under the 
     accounts ``Executive Offices'', ``Administrative Support 
     Offices'', ``Program Offices'', ``Government National 
     Mortgage Association--Guarantees of Mortgage-Backed 
     Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and ``Office of 
     Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and 
     Urban Development.
       Sec. 216.  The Secretary shall, for fiscal year 2021, 
     notify the public through the Federal Register and other 
     means, as determined appropriate, of the issuance of a notice 
     of the availability of assistance or notice of funding 
     availability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary fund 
     administered by the Secretary that is to be competitively 
     awarded. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for 
     fiscal year 2021, the Secretary may make the NOFA available 
     only on the Internet at the appropriate Government web site 
     or through other electronic media, as determined by the 
     Secretary.
       Sec. 217.  Payment of attorney fees in program-related 
     litigation shall be paid from the individual program office 
     and Office of General Counsel salaries and expenses 
     appropriations. The annual budget submission for the program 
     offices and the Office of General Counsel shall include any 
     such projected litigation costs for attorney fees as a 
     separate line item request.
       Sec. 218. (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
     Secretary may transfer up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, 
     whichever is less, of funds appropriated for any office under 
     the headings ``Administrative Support Offices'' or ``Program 
     Offices'' to any other such office under such heading: 
     Provided, That no appropriation for any such office or 
     account shall be increased or decreased by more than 10 
     percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less, without prior 
     written approval of the House and Senate Committees on 
     Appropriations: Provided further, That the Secretary shall 
     provide notification to such Committees not less than 3 
     business days in advance of any such transfers under this 
     section up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less.
       (2) The authority under paragraph (1) to transfer funds

     Homes, or the Office of Departmental Equal Employment 
     Opportunity.
       (b) The Secretary is authorized to transfer up to 10 
     percent of funds appropriated for any office under the 
     headings ``Administrative Support Offices'' or ``Program 
     Offices'' to the Office of Fair Housing and Equal 
     Opportunity, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy 
     Homes, or the Office of Departmental Equal Employment 
     Opportunity: Provided, That no amounts may be transferred 
     pursuant to this subparagraph unless the Secretary shall 
     provide notification to such Committees not less 3 business 
     days in advance of any such transfers under this subsection.
       Sec. 219. (a) Any entity receiving housing assistance 
     payments shall maintain decent, safe, and sanitary 
     conditions, as determined by the Secretary, and comply with 
     any standards under applicable State or local laws, rules, 
     ordinances, or regulations relating to the physical condition 
     of any property covered under a housing assistance payment 
     contract.
       (b) The Secretary shall take action under subsection (c) 
     when a multifamily housing project with a contract under 
     section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 
     1437f) or a contract for similar project-based assistance--
       (1) receives a Uniform Physical Condition Standards (UPCS) 
     score of 60 or less; or
       (2) fails to certify in writing to the Secretary within 3 
     days that all Exigent Health and Safety deficiencies 
     identified by the inspector at the project have been 
     corrected.
     Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured 
     projects with assistance attached to the units under section 
     8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), 
     but shall not apply to such units assisted under section 
     8(o)(13) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public 
     housing units assisted with capital or operating funds under 
     section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.

       (c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the Real Estate 
     Assessment Center (``REAC'') inspection, the Secretary shall 
     provide the owner with a Notice of Default with a specified 
     timetable, determined by the Secretary, for correcting all 
     deficiencies. The Secretary shall provide a copy of the 
     Notice of Default to the tenants, the local government, any 
     mortgagees, and any contract administrator. If the owner's 
     appeal results in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the Secretary 
     may withdraw the Notice of Default.
       (2) At the end of the time period for correcting all

     with a management agent approved by the Secretary;
       (B) impose civil money penalties, which shall be used

     project deficiencies;
       (H) work with the owner, lender, or other related party to 
     stabilize the property in an attempt to preserve the property 
     through compliance, transfer of ownership, or an infusion of 
     capital provided by a third-party that requires time to 
     effectuate; or
       (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies 
     available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the 
     Secretary.
       (d) The Secretary shall take appropriate steps to ensure 
     that project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the 
     exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist 
     relocation of tenants for major threats to health and safety 
     after written notice to the affected tenants. To the extent 
     the Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants 
     and the local government, that the property is not feasible 
     for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
     or other programs, based on consideration of--
       (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property 
     and all available Federal, State, and local resources, 
     including rent adjustments under section 524 of the 
     Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 
     1997 (``MAHRAA''), and

     scores of less than 60 or have received an unsatisfactory 
     management and occupancy review within the past 36 months. 
     The report shall include--
       (1) identification of the enforcement actions being taken 
     to address such conditions, including imposition of civil 
     money penalties and termination of subsidies, and 
     identification of properties that have such conditions 
     multiple times;
       (2) identification of actions that the Department of 
     Housing and Urban Development is taking to protect tenants of 
     such identified properties; and
       (3) any administrative or legislative recommendations to 
     further improve the living conditions at properties covered 
     under a housing assistance payment contract.

       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any grantee 
     of funds referred to in subsection (a) of this section may 
     request a waiver from the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
     Development of any recoupment by the Secretary of such funds

     the Secretary in such request that it has verified that the 
     individual conditions of each person it is requesting a 
     waiver for meets one of the conditions specified in the 
     preceding sentence, the Secretary may grant such waivers on 
     the basis of grantee self-certification, issue a public 
     determination by publication in the Federal Register that it 
     is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to 
     pursue such recoupment, and may conduct oversight to verify 
     grantee self-certification and subject the grantee to 
     remedies for noncompliance for any amounts that have not met 
     such requirements.
       (d) Amounts repurposed pursuant to this section that were 
     previously designated by the Congress as an emergency 
     requirement pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
     Deficit Control Act of 1985 are designated by the Congress as 
     an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) 
     of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
     1985.

                             General Leave

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure under consideration
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Today, we continue investing for the people with H.R. 7617.
  This minibus combines six appropriations bills: Defense, Commerce-
Justice-Science, Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and 
General Government, Labor-HHS-Education, and Transportation-Housing and 
Urban Development.
  The bill promotes economic recovery from the devastating COVID-19 
pandemic. It provides more than $200 billion in emergency funding to 
rebuild our Nation's transportation, housing, and energy 
infrastructure; to expand broadband to unserved and underserved areas; 
and to rebuild the Nation's aged public health capacity and support 
State and local health agencies and global health activities.
  The bill prioritizes public health and safety with $47 billion for 
lifesaving medical research at the National Institutes of Health and 
$50 million, an increase of $25 million above fiscal year 2020, for 
firearm injury and mortality prevention research at the NIH and CDC. It 
includes strong funding for numerous public health efforts, including 
initiatives to reduce HIV infections, address tobacco and e-cigarette 
use, and ensure food safety.
  As we confront the twin crises of COVID-19 and systemic racism, the 
bill

[[Page H4112]]

takes bold steps to build safer and stronger communities for all 
people. It provides strong funding to support law enforcement reform at 
the State and local level while catalyzing economic development in 
disadvantaged communities that is fundamental to a more just and 
equitable society.
  Among other priorities, the bill invests in education and job 
training; expands access to safe, affordable, and fair housing; 
supports servicemembers and military families; and combats climate 
change and embraces a clean energy future.
  This package prioritizes the lives and livelihoods of the American 
people and makes the strong investments needed to build a stronger 
future for every person.
  It is the product of months of thoughtful deliberation and input from 
Members on both sides of the aisle. I am proud of the work we have 
completed under the incredibly difficult circumstances of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Our incredibly talented appropriations subcommittee chairs 
will discuss more about what this package does for the people.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  As the vice ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. 
Speaker, I stand today in opposition to H.R. 7617, the second set of 
fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills to be considered by the House.
  This minibus of six bills includes the two largest, Defense and 
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as the titles 
covering Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy and Water Development, 
Financial Services and General Government, and, finally, 
Transportation-Housing and Urban Development.
  While I am always encouraged to see the process of funding government 
underway in Congress, Democrats, unfortunately, chose a deeply flawed 
approach in exercising this function for fiscal year 2021.
  Remember, nearly a year ago, Mr. Speaker, Congress passed and 
President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, 
which set budgetary levels for fiscal years 2020 and 2021. This 
bipartisan and bicameral compromise was the result of a good faith 
negotiation between the President and congressional leadership. Last 
year, my friends on their side of the aisle actually kept that 
agreement, and we had an orderly appropriations process, a successful 
outcome, and we have had no government shutdowns, no long-term 
continuing resolutions.
  This year, however, despite this existing agreement, Democrats on the 
House Appropriations Committee chose to write bills that greatly exceed 
the spending limits allowed for fiscal year 2021. In fact, they did so 
through extensive use of a budget gimmick that designates certain funds 
as emergency.
  Without question, there are many worthwhile items and priorities in 
these six bills before us, Mr. Speaker, but I remain concerned about 
the use of emergency designated funds as a workaround and scheme to 
break the budget agreement between the two parties and the President.
  In fact, in this bill alone, there is well over $200 billion of this 
so-called emergency spending, clearly in violation of the budget 
agreement. $186 billion is included in the infrastructure title without 
any bipartisan discussion or agreement. Another $24 billion is included 
to address the coronavirus, even though discussions and negotiations 
are underway on another supplemental specifically for that purpose.
  These funds were added without any consultation with House 
Republicans, with the Senate, or with the President, and without that 
consultation, they have no chance of becoming law.
  Now, let's remember, Mr. Speaker, some of the critical things these 
six appropriations titles are supposed to support each year: our 
dedicated servicemembers who put their lives on the line every day to 
defend and preserve our precious freedom; our courageous law 
enforcement officers who keep our communities safe; our hardworking 
small business owners and their workers who are seeking to achieve the 
American Dream; our vital researchers who are looking for lifesaving 
treatments and cures; our ports and waterways that are so critical to 
commerce; and, finally, they support our transit system upon which many 
Americans depend daily.

  All these things are put at risk, Mr. Speaker, unless Democrats and 
Republicans work together.
  Unfortunately, along with the unworkable approach taken in writing 
this package of bills, there are many partisan policy positions that 
must come out before it can become law. Many of these partisan 
provisions are similar to policies pushed through the House in recent 
months.
  Considering that the committee has had more than 100 hearings and 
briefings to make important funding decisions, it is disappointing that 
many of these provisions seem to have been dictated from the top.
  A few examples:
  The bill jeopardizes our safety and security by allowing terrorists 
detained at Guantanamo Bay to be brought to U.S. soil.
  It also includes language that would prevent the United States from 
exercising the right to defend ourselves and our allies, such as 
Israel.
  In a time when China is seeking to dominate the world order, this 
bill would undermine America's preeminence in space exploration and 
cede the opportunity to China to dominate the next frontier.
  Also concerning, this minibus plays into the dangerous narrative of 
defunding the police through its failure to provide adequate funding 
for our Federal law enforcement agencies.
  Moreover, State and local law enforcement agencies are barred from 
receiving excess equipment from the Department of Defense.
  As the ranking member of the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee, I am, 
of course, most familiar with the partisan provisions contained there. 
Indeed, the text of that bill includes a wide variety of harmful 
riders.
  First, it includes a partisan policy prescription that will tie the 
hands of the administration with respect to the Title X family planning 
program. Most notably, the riders would force the administration to 
resume grants awarded to controversial groups that provide abortions, 
such as Planned Parenthood, and it would prevent the administration 
from granting waivers that protect deeply held religious beliefs of 
institutions, organizations, and individuals that provide vital 
services funded in the bill.
  The Labor-HHS title also includes riders that would undo the 
Department of Labor's rule clarifying the joint employer standard. If 
this policy rider were enacted, it would cause chaos for thousands of 
businesses and millions of employees, leaving them uncertain about the 
nature of the employment relationship.
  Not to be outdone, this bill also includes riders micromanaging and 
second-guessing how HHS administers the Unaccompanied Alien Children 
Program, which will ensure that the individuals devoting their energies 
to assisting such unaccompanied minors will find themselves devoting 
their energy to becoming wrapped up evermore deeply in congressionally 
mandated red tape.
  Again, the same can be said for the other five divisions of this 
package. Throughout this minibus, the Democratic majority has inserted 
policy riders that tie the hands of the administration. They have 
limited the ability of the administration to reprogram funds, even when 
necessary. They have inserted rider after rider aimed at preventing the 
President from spending money on barriers and security measures at the 
southern border. And they have removed countless bipartisan policy 
provisions that have been carried in previous year's bills.
  When it comes to Congress' fundamental function of keeping the 
government open and operating, good faith negotiation must be present 
at every stage. In this era of divided government, that might be 
challenging, but we have proven time and time again that it is 
certainly not impossible.
  We did it when we negotiated the 2019 budget agreement. We did it 
again when we moved through an orderly process for the 2020 fiscal year 
appropriations bills. And, finally, we did it most recently on four 
separate occasions in dealing with the coronavirus.
  All of these successes were the product of bipartisan negotiation in 
divided government. In those negotiations, neither side can dictate to 
the other or jam the other, or failure will result.

[[Page H4113]]

  In the days ahead, Mr. Speaker, we must work together on 
appropriations bills that reflect the bipartisan budget agreement and 
leave out controversial policy language. Until we do that, no 
appropriations bill will make it to the President's desk, and we will 
run the risk later this year of either a long-term continuing 
resolution or even a government shutdown.
  For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to the second 
minibus package, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Energy and 
Water Development, and Related Agencies.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member 
Granger, and Vice Ranking Member Cole.
  Please let me add my thanks to Chair Lowey for her years of 
honorable, dedicated, and affable service to this committee and to our 
Nation and for her recognition of the full potential of the Energy and 
Water division.
  Truly, she will be missed. Without question, she has made her mark 
across our Nation and the world. She can draw great satisfaction from 
that.
  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my brother, Stephen, who is 
watching from a distance. Without his strength and courage, I would not 
be here today.
  This bill represents an overwhelming majority of our total 
discretionary appropriations, and with its passage, the House's 
completion of 10 appropriation bills.
  Mr. Speaker, I extend congratulations to Chairwoman Lowey and, of 
course, Ranking Member Kay Granger for this feat in the middle of a 
global pandemic.
  Mr. Speaker, I also have to thank the marvelous committee staff who 
have made this possible. I wish to say that the Energy and Water 
division captures the American spirit of ingenuity and independence in 
our enterprising Nation.
  Our bill lays the foundation for critical investments to combat 
climate change. It is poised to pass today as the most important funded 
climate change bill the 116th Congress will pass.

                              {time}  1045

  Truly, this bill will sustain life in America and address global 
imperatives.
  Our bill upgrades and strengthens our Nation's energy and water 
infrastructure.
  It responsibly funds our Nation's nuclear deterrent. It rejects the 
administration's dangerous plan to start nuclear explosive testing.
  The bill rejects the President's drastic and shortsighted proposed 
cuts that would harm America's leadership at home and abroad. Instead, 
it invests in important programs that keep our Nation at the forefront 
of global energy innovation.
  It enables the efficient shipment of goods. It provides water, 
irrigation, and electricity to millions upon millions of Americans, and 
these programs propel real economic growth and the jobs that go with 
it.
  Let me briefly walk through the bill.
  The Army Corps of Engineers receives $7.6 billion, the second year of 
record funding and an increase of $1.7 billion above the budget 
request.
  The Bureau of Reclamation receives $1.64 billion, an increase of $508 
million above the request.
  The Department of Energy receives $41 billion, an increase of $5.1 
billion above the request. Within the Department of Energy, the bill 
contains historic funding levels for key programs critical to our 
future.
  First, energy efficiency and renewable energy receive $2.85 billion, 
$2.1 billion above the request. ARPA-E, our advanced energy portfolio, 
receives $435 million, a record amount for a program the President 
proposed to eliminate, blunting America's future.
  The Office of Science receives $7.05 billion, $1.2 billion above the 
request.
  This bill also provides an increase for the home Weatherization 
Assistance Program. It helps ensure that additional low-income 
households have energy-efficient and more livable and affordable 
futures in communities across our Nation.
  The National Nuclear Security Administration receives $18 billion, 
$1.3 billion above 2020. Within the Nuclear Security Administration, 
the bill responsibly funds America's nuclear deterrent.
  Nuclear nonproliferation receives $2.24 billion, an increase of $209 
million above the request.
  Finally, this bill prohibits the diversion of essential Army Corps 
funds to be used for a border wall. In addition to regular 
appropriations, the bill cues up additional investments that will spur 
a job-rich, robust economic recovery by modernizing our water and 
energy infrastructure.
  I cannot thank our chair more for her efforts to make sure this 
occurs, including $17 billion to accelerate backlogged Army Corps of 
Engineers projects across this Nation; $3 billion to accelerate work on 
authorized reclamation projects; and $25.3 billion for the Department 
of Energy to modernize infrastructure and deploy technologies for our 
Nation's future clean energy.
  In sum, the Energy and Water division will help put America back to 
work. It makes desperately needed investments in crumbling water 
infrastructure across the Nation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an 
additional 30 seconds.
  Ms. KAPTUR. It maintains a credible nuclear deterrent while 
supporting a robust nonproliferation program.
  I would like to thank our ranking member, Mr. Simpson, for his 
partnership and thank our subcommittee staff for their hard work: Jaime 
Shimek, Farouk Ophaso, Scott McKee, Marcel Caldwell, Mike Brain, Mark 
Arnone, and Angie Giancarlo on the other side.
  I want to thank all of our committee members, especially dear friends 
like Chairman Visclosky; Chairman Serrano; Chairwoman Lowey; and on the 
Republican side, Mr. Graves, all of whom are retiring. They will take 
with them over a century of cumulative legislative knowledge that 
simply cannot be replaced.
  It is a profound contribution but also a great loss to our Nation as 
you depart. May God bless you all.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), my good friend, the ranking 
member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in opposition to H.R. 
7617.
  I do appreciate the efforts of the majority in producing the FY 2021 
appropriations package that we are considering on the floor today. This 
bill addresses many priorities and concerns that Members on both sides 
of the aisle have.
  There are a lot of things in this bill that we all agree on, 
particularly in division B of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
  I do want to thank Chairman Serrano for including the resources 
necessary to work toward completion of the Space Launch System, or, as 
it is commonly called, the SLS, including no less than $400 million for 
the Block 1B version of the Space Launch System.
  With its powerful Exploration Upper Stage and the 8.4-meter payload 
fairing, the Block 1B represents a transformational strategic 
capability for the United States and deep-space exploration.
  NASA must increase the pace of SLS production to ensure that a Space 
Launch System is available for the Europa missions and other future 
science missions, in addition to meeting all human exploration needs.
  I also want to thank Chairman Serrano. Of course, as has been said, 
he is going to be retiring after this term. We certainly will miss him 
around here in the House Chamber and the Capitol complex.
  I want to thank him also for including $110 million for the nuclear 
thermal propulsion, a level necessary to work toward the design of a 
flight demonstration by 2024.
  In addition to some key space priorities, the bill also addresses 
issues impacting all of our communities. It increases funding for 
critical drug court programs and other vital initiatives that address 
the opioid epidemic, as well as the DNA analysis programs

[[Page H4114]]

that are helping to solve cold cases and eliminate the backlog of 
sexual assault cases.

  The bill also rightly directs the Department of Justice to undertake 
novel approaches to addressing online child exploitation, obscenity, 
and human trafficking.
  In addition, the bill includes strong funding for the agencies to 
ensure compliance with trade laws and agreements. I am especially 
pleased that it funds the aluminum import monitoring program.
  The bill also supports the administration's Industries of the Future 
initiative with new investments in quantum information science, 
artificial intelligence, 5G research, and advanced manufacturing.
  Finally, I want to thank Chairman Serrano and his staff for including 
$10 million for the VORTEX Southeast program. The number of killer 
tornadoes in the southeastern part of the United States is really 
disproportionate to the overall number of tornadoes throughout the 
country. VORTEX Southeast is doing critical work to better understand 
environmental factors and improve weather forecast communications in my 
home region of the South and Southeast.
  However, with all of this being said, the strong funding that is in 
some areas of this bill, unfortunately, it makes the deficiencies in 
this bill even more glaring.
  For example, we all saw for ourselves several weeks ago, when the 
Nation witnessed the first U.S.-based launch of astronauts in 10 years, 
the passion of the American people at that time for a renewed era of 
space exploration and a recognition of the strategic value of U.S. 
space supremacy.
  Yet, this bill that we are debating today rejects America's Moon-to-
Mars Artemis initiative and the capabilities needed to land the first 
woman on the Moon by 2024.
  Worse still, this bill caters to the radical demands of defunding so 
many of our law enforcement agencies across the board. None of the 
Federal law enforcement agencies in this bill, including the FBI, the 
ATF, the DEA, or the U.S. Marshals Service, are fully funded in this 
legislation.
  The Attorney General has made fighting gun crime one of his 
priorities, yet none of his initiatives received the requested 
increase. Even bipartisan requests to address violent gun crime, along 
with the request to increase resources for the investigation and 
prosecution of human trafficking, child exploitation, and high-tech 
organized crime at the Federal level, have been marginalized in this 
bill.
  The bill includes so many new unauthorized conditions on the Byrne 
JAG and COPS programs, it seems these grants will basically be halted 
indefinitely.
  I have no doubt that our side of the aisle could have supported some 
bipartisan police training reforms and other policy initiatives, had 
the majority not bowed to the pressure of defunding so many of these 
programs.
  The bill also sets a terrible precedent by proposing to use hard-
earned taxpayer dollars to defend people crossing the border illegally. 
Sadly, it will only serve to further entice people to make that 
dangerous journey as they head north.
  This bill eliminates several longstanding Second Amendment 
protections that have enjoyed historical bipartisan support. The 
elimination of freedoms that are not even associated with firearms is 
an unfortunate outgrowth of the gun control agenda with no basis in the 
science of criminal justice.
  In closing, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey and Chairman Serrano and 
all of their staff for their hard work. They both have great careers, 
and we will certainly miss them.
  Just in closing, I do want to say thanks to the minority staff: 
Stephanie Gadbois, Darren Benjamin, and Kristin Clarkson, along with 
the majority staff, Bob Bonner, Jeff Ashford, Trisha Castaneda, Faye 
Cobb, T.J. Lowdermilk, Shannon McCully, and B.G. Wright.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Alabama an 
additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. I continue to be committed to working with the majority 
in good faith as we proceed through the legislative process, and I look 
forward to the debate that we will have today.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, it is such an honor for me to yield to the next speaker, 
the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), who is the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Defense.
  Mr. Visclosky has announced that he is going to retire, but he has 
committed so much of his knowledge, his energy, to a bill that requires 
a lot of knowledge of detail. It is a very, very difficult bill, but 
Mr. Visclosky has mastered it.
  At the same time that the gentleman has focused on this very 
important bill, he remembers all of his constituents back home. My 
vision of Mr. Visclosky was writing notes and participating in the 
hearing, but it was clear to me that the gentleman served every one of 
his constituents with distinction as well as being chairman of this 
committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. Visclosky: Good luck, my friend. Good 
health, my friend. I wish you everything the best on your retirement, 
and more time with family and friends.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. 
Visclosky), the outstanding chair of the Subcommittee on Defense.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairwoman for her 
very kind remarks. I also want to thank Nita for her friendship over 
the years. As I am going to again mention in my prepared remarks, the 
gentlewoman's life of service to not only her constituency, not only to 
this great Nation, but to the people of the world, given all of her 
work on the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Agencies, and again, having a broad, long-term view of dedicating her 
life to make sure that the world we leave is going to be better for our 
children and posterity.
  So I appreciate that as well. As I have quipped, if the gentlewoman 
is not going to be back next year, I am not going to be back next year.
  I, first of all, do want to thank my ranking member and my friend, 
Mr. Calvert, for his continued commitment to being collegial, 
transparent, and bipartisan.
  I cannot overstate the value of the gentleman's friendship and the 
partnership we have enjoyed over the years. He is a gentleman.
  Further, I would again appreciate and acknowledge the work of 
chairwoman, Mrs. Lowey, who is also departing the House at the end of 
this year. Again I commend you, Nita, for your dedicated life of 
service and a commitment to leaving this world better. Thank you very 
much.

                              {time}  1100

  I want to also thank the subcommittee staff, particularly our clerks, 
Becky Leggieri and Johnnie Kaberle; as well as Walter Hearne, Brooke 
Boyer, Ariana Sarar, Kiya Batmanglidj, Jackie Ripke, David Bortnick, 
Matt Bower, Bill Adkins, Jennifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, Paul 
Kilbride, Shannon Richter, Sherry Young, Kyle McFarland, Jamie 
McCormick, Brian Potts, and Nick Vance; those in Ranking Member 
Calvert's personal office, as well, Rebecca Keightley and William 
Hendrickson; and my personal staff, Joe DeVooght and our fellow from 
the Department of Defense, Major Stephen Cash.
  I am profoundly grateful to each for their dedicated service to the 
public, for their acumen, and for their generosity of spirit.
  The bill continues to focus on the well-being and morale of those in 
uniform and their families as well as DOD civilians and their 
communities. The bill provides an additional $116 million for upgrades 
to childcare facilities, and the report contains language directing the 
military services to present innovative ideas to address the serious 
backlog for childcare.
  It provides $1.49 billion for environmental restoration activities, 
which is $415 million above the request.
  We provide $327 million to address the ongoing epidemic of sexual 
assault in the military and at the service academies, which is $49 
million more than requested. Despite dire warnings, the Department's 
budget for sexual assault prevention and response remains stagnant. The 
Department has got to do a much better job.

[[Page H4115]]

  Another area of deep concern for me is the Department's lack of 
compliance with many congressionally directed reporting requirements. 
For example, last year, the committee directed the Department to submit 
a report on its contracts for advertising services with socially and 
economically disadvantaged small businesses. The report was supposed to 
accompany the Department's fiscal year 2021 budgets submission in 
February, but it was transmitted to the committee on July 14, 5 months 
late and the same day we marked up the bill. Regrettably, reporting 
deadlines are often missed, making it much more difficult for the 
committee to make timely decisions.
  The bill, again, contains several provisions to rein in the 
Department's now habitual redirection of funding and contravention of 
congressional intent. One DOD official in a meeting earlier this year 
referred to these transfers of $10 billion as anomalies. I refer to 
them as habitual abuses. The sense of entitlement in these actions is 
galling, and I hope that at some point the Department will have the 
leadership in place to recognize it is Congress' constitutional 
prerogative and restore trust to the appropriations process.

  Mr. Speaker, before I begin with my remarks on the fiscal year (FY) 
2021 bill, I would like to briefly discuss some concerns I have as a 
longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee.
  The Committee has a unique responsibility. It is charged with funding 
and oversight of the entire government, and ensuring that it is as 
effective and as efficient as possible. However, in some ways, the 
Committee is at its nadir in terms of its ability to achieve bipartisan 
solutions. In part, this is due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, 
which is an ill-fated attempt to balance the federal budget by cutting 
only discretionary spending.
  Currently, mandatory spending and interest on the debt represent 70 
percent of the money spent each year by the federal government. 
Discretionary spending, which is an investment in the future, makes up 
just 30 percent of federal spending. When less than 30 percent of young 
Americans are qualified to join the military, it is clear we need to 
invest more in our nation's health, education, infrastructure, and 
jobs. Unfortunately, from my perspective, recent Congresses have 
mistakenly relied on mandatory spending to avoid making difficult 
decisions on discretionary spending on an annual basis. A case in 
point, last week the House passed a bill that will provide much needed 
funding to address the maintenance backlog in our public lands. But the 
bill utilizes mandatory funding mechanisms that further decrease the 
ability of Congress and the Appropriations Committee to exercise annual 
discretion and oversight.
  I implore my colleagues who serve in the next Congress to avoid 
repeating the mistakes of the recent past. The lasting solution to our 
nation's fiscal problems will only be realized by confronting the 
continued growth in mandatory spending while simultaneously increasing 
revenues. In the year 2000, the last year the federal government had a 
surplus, revenues, as a percentage of GDP, were 20 percent. In fiscal 
year 2019, revenues were 16.3 percent. We need revenue to invest in the 
future of our country, and every appropriated dollar is an investment.
  Moving onto the FY 2021 bill, I first want to thank my Ranking Member 
and friend, Mr. Calvert, for his continued commitment to being 
collegial, transparent, and bipartisan. I cannot overstate the value of 
his friendship and the partnership we have enjoyed over the years.
  I also want to express my sincere gratitude to Chairwoman Lowey and 
Ranking Member Granger. We would not be here without their leadership 
and dedication.
  Further, I would like to acknowledge that Chairwoman Lowey will be 
joining me in departing the House at the end of this year. I commend 
her for a dedicated life of service and commitment to leaving this 
world a little bit better than the way she found it. Thank you very 
much. It is a joy to work with you.
  I want to thank the Subcommittee staff, particularly, our clerks, 
Becky Leggieri and Johnnie Kaberle, as well as Walter Hearne, Brooke 
Boyer, Ariana Sarar, Jackie Ripke, David Bortnick, Matt Bower, Bill 
Adkins, Jennifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, Paul Kilbride, Shannon 
Richter, Sherry Young, Kyle McFarland, Kiya Batmanglidj, Jamie 
McCormick, Brian Potts, and Nick Vance, my personal office staff, Joe 
DeVooght and Stephen Cash, and those in Ranking Member Calvert's 
personal office, Rebecca Keightley and William Hendrickson. Having to 
assemble the bulk of the bill and report remotely increased the degree 
of difficulty substantially, as it has for all of the subcommittees. I 
commend them for their professionalism and acumen.
  The bill would provide $694.6 billion for the Department of Defense 
budget, which is $1.3 billion above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level 
and $3. 7 billion below the request. The base funding recommendation is 
$626.2 billion, which is $3.5 billion above the fiscal year 2020 
enacted level and $3.5 billion below the request. The overseas 
contingency operations recommendation is $68.4 billion, which is $2.2 
billion below the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $215 million below 
the request.
  This legislation recognizes the complex challenges the members of our 
Armed Forces and intelligence community face every day throughout the 
world, and it aims to ensure that they are able to continue to meet 
these challenges and complete their missions to the best of their 
abilities. To support this forward-looking posture, the bill makes 
major investments in operations and maintenance, procurement, and 
research and development.
  I also think it is important to highlight some investments the 
Committee has made with regards to the current COVID-19 pandemic. This 
legislation would provide:
  $758 million in procurement for COVID-19 recovery for second, third 
and fourth tier suppliers. This has been of particular interest to Mr. 
Calvert, and I appreciate his advocacy of this issue;
  $450 million in operation and maintenance for COVID-19 recovery and 
resupply; and
  $150 million in the Defense Health Program for COVID-19 response.
  In addition to the funding enumerated above, the legislation places 
several reporting requirements on the Department specific to COVID-19. 
The budgetary impacts of the pandemic on the Department are still 
largely undetermined. Some programs will cost more. However, there will 
be savings obtained through delayed or cancelled events and activities. 
It is imperative that the Committee and Congress have as much detail as 
possible to properly delegate funding and to conduct oversight.
  And most importantly, the bill continues to focus on the well-being 
and morale of those in uniform and their families, as well as DoD 
civilians and their communities.
  The bill provides an additional $116 million for upgrades to 
childcare facilities and the report contains language directing the 
military services to present innovative ideas to address the serious 
backlog for childcare.
  The bill provides $1.49 billion for environmental restoration 
activities, which is $415 million above the request. This increased 
funding will help DoD address the significant and salient public health 
risks associated with PFOS/PFOA.
  The bill and report take steps to stop the Department from closing 
military treatment facilities and from reducing military healthcare 
billets, which would have cost $334.6 million this fiscal year. These 
plans were poorly justified to the Committee prior to the pandemic, and 
even harder to defend under current conditions.
  The bill provides $327 million to address the ongoing epidemic of 
sexual assault in the military and at the service academies, which is 
$49 million more than requested. And I must express my personal upset 
over this issue. The most recent report on the sexual assault rate for 
women has jumped a shocking 50 percent from 2016 to 2018. Despite dire 
warnings, the Department's budget for sexual assault prevention and 
response remains stagnant. And I would also say it is not just a 
question of money. Year after year after year, we have testimony from 
officials who contend that they are really committed to solving this 
problem. And yet we are going backwards. The Department must do a much 
better job.
  These efforts and several others within the bill will have an 
immediate positive impact on people's quality of life.
  Another area of concern for me is the Department's lack of compliance 
with many Congressionally directed reporting requirements. For example, 
last year the Committee directed the Department to submit a report on 
its contracts for advertising services with socially and economically 
disadvantaged small businesses. The report was supposed to accompany 
the Department's FY 2021 budget submission in February, but it was 
transmitted to the Committee on July 14, five months late and the same 
day we marked up the bill. Regrettably, reporting deadlines are often 
missed, making it much more difficult for the Committee to make timely 
decisions.
  The bill, again, contains several provisions to rein in the 
Department's habitual redirection of funding and contravention of 
congressional intent. These actions have irreparably damaged the 
Department's credibility with the Committee. One DoD official, in a 
meeting, referred to these transfers of billions of dollars as 
anomalies. I refer to them as habitual abuses by the Department.
  In recent years, the Department leadership has not missed an 
opportunity to claim that a 3 percent to 5 percent annual growth rate 
in the defense budget is necessary to support the National Defense 
Strategy. But at the

[[Page H4116]]

same time, those same leaders facilitated the transfer of nearly $10 
billion to non-defense activities not enumerated in their own National 
Defense Strategy. And while this was happening, they also have the 
temerity to repeatedly request more flexibility from Congress for 
executing their budget and for reprogramming authorities. The sense of 
entitlement in these actions is galling, and I hope that at some point 
the Department will have the leadership in place to recognize 
Congress's constitutional prerogative and restore trust to the 
appropriations process.
  In closing, I would again thank my chair, ranking member, and all of 
the members, who have logged so many hours in making this bill 
possible. I look forward to debate on the amendments.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. Simpson). My very good friend is the ranking member on the Energy 
and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on 
Appropriations.
  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to H.R. 7617, the 
six-bill fiscal year 2021 appropriations package that includes the 
Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.
  I had hoped to have been able to support the appropriations bill this 
year. Unfortunately, while the bill includes some bipartisan 
priorities, excessive spending and partisan riders mean I am unable to 
support the bill at this time.
  I am pleased that the bill continues significant investments in our 
Nation's water resources infrastructure, including harbor maintenance 
activities. Unfortunately, the majority is choosing to ignore several 
opportunities to enhance water security in the drought-prone West. The 
bill cuts funding for water storage projects, blocks a critical water 
storage project in California, and unnecessarily delays the use of 
previously appropriated funds for other water storage projects.
  Republicans--in fact, I think every Republican from the California 
delegation--filed multiple amendments to correct these problems, but 
none of them were made in order. Even a simple amendment to highlight 
the importance of funding for water storage projects was left out of 
the rule.
  In fact, every other Energy and Water amendment that followed the 
same format was made in order and will be in en bloc amendments 
expected to be adopted. Yet the majority refused to allow the full 
House to even consider and to even debate these critical Western water 
storage issues.
  One bipartisan priority of great importance to me is the Department 
of Energy's nuclear energy program. While the bill addresses several 
priority activities within the program, overall funding for the program 
is not reflective of its importance to the national and global energy 
future.
  The committee report repeatedly expresses the majority's intent to 
address climate change, and we have heard that today several times. Yet 
nuclear energy, a carbon-free, baseload source of power, suffers one of 
the largest cuts from enacted levels in the entire bill.
  I am pleased to support Mr. Weber's amendment highlighting the 
importance of the versatile test reactor. This project will provide a 
capability that will help with the development of next-generation fast 
neutron reactors as well as benefit materials development for today's 
reactors. I am hopeful that, moving forward, we can work together 
towards stronger funding for the entire nuclear energy program, 
including the versatile test reactor.
  One of my main concerns with the bill is the significant amount of 
emergency spending, mandatory spending, and other gimmicks that 
effectively undermine the defense and nondefense spending levels agreed 
to in last year's bipartisan budget deal.
  The emergency spending provisions alone almost double the cost of the 
Energy and Water bill, all without discussion, let alone buy-in from 
House Republicans. That is why I support Mr. Perry's amendment to 
strike the emergency spending in the Energy and Water bill. If there is 
a demonstrated need for spending above and beyond the bipartisan caps, 
it should only occur as a result of bipartisan discussions on that 
issue, not as a partisan title to an annual appropriations bill.
  Even with all the additional spending, however, the bill still 
shortchanges funding for the nuclear weapons program by almost $2 
billion. Currently, much of our nuclear weapons complex infrastructure 
is old, outdated, and some of it is literally falling apart. We must 
uphold our Nation's strong nuclear deterrence posture, and to do that, 
we must adequately fund the activities necessary to maintain a safe, 
reliable, and effective nuclear weapons stockpile.
  The bill includes numerous policy riders and authorizing provisions, 
most of which we know will be unacceptable to the administration and 
will need to be addressed before a final bill can be enacted. I believe 
one of these riders is intended to reaffirm current law with respect to 
the authority of the Secretary of Energy, and I strongly support that 
intent.
  The House will consider an amendment to strike this language due to 
concerns that the text goes beyond the intent and would unintentionally 
disrupt the important work of the Nuclear Weapons Council. While I 
certainly understand those concerns, I am also concerned about recent 
efforts in the Senate to undermine the authority of the Secretary of 
Energy.
  The Secretary must continue to have full authority for appropriately 
balancing priorities across the entire Department, including the 
nuclear weapons program. Unless or until those Senate efforts are 
defeated once and for all, I believe it would be better to improve the 
bill text to avoid unintended consequences rather than strike the 
language entirely.
  Finally, I am disappointed that the bill does not include any funding 
to advance the Yucca Mountain license application process and, instead, 
offers a false promise of interim storage as a solution to the nuclear 
waste issue. Continuing the license process is how we ensure an 
authoritative scientific decision--not a political decision--on the 
safety of Yucca Mountain.
  Over the past few decades, electricity customers across the country 
have paid roughly $43 billion, with accrued interest, into the nuclear 
waste fund for permanent disposal of nuclear waste. Due to the 
political decision to halt advancement of a permanent repository, 
however, it is the taxpayers--not the ratepayers, but the taxpayers in 
all 435 congressional districts--who currently are paying approximately 
$2.2 million per day, or more than $800 million per year, to cover the 
cost of temporary onsite storage.
  There has long been broad, bipartisan support for continuing the 
Yucca Mountain licensing process, and the Energy and Water bill should 
reflect that reality.

  Despite our disagreements over the issues I have mentioned, I want to 
close by thanking Chairwoman Kaptur and the majority staff for their 
dedication and hard work on this bill. Ms. Kaptur has continued the 
cooperative tradition of the subcommittee, even during this year's 
unusual circumstances, and I appreciate that very much.
  I would also like to thank Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member 
Granger for their support.
  Lastly, I would like to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle, 
particularly my staff in my office, Sarah Cannon, who is on kind of 
semi-leave about ready to deliver another child. So she does a great 
job.
  I look forward to working together as this bill moves forward in the 
legislative process to develop a final Energy and Water bill that 
reflects a balanced set of priorities.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is the outstanding and passionate chair 
of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and 
Related Agencies.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on a portion of the bill 
for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.
  To start, let me commend my dear friend, the chair of the full 
Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Nita Lowey, who is a path 
breaker and a change maker. Nita Lowey has made this Nation and the 
world a far better place because of the commitments that she has to the 
issues that come before this subcommittee: quality education, after 
school programs, and protections for working men and women.
  Under her leadership, appropriations proceeded despite, and in 
response to, this virus and the disparities that it

[[Page H4117]]

has exposed. She is a force. She leaves a legacy of excellence and of 
innovation, and, as I have said before on a number of occasions, I will 
miss my friend. I will miss her in the Halls, and I will miss her in 
committee, but our friendship carries on.
  Also, I want to say thank you to Ranking Member Cole for his 
friendship and for his gracious, collaborative spirit in which we work 
together on the Labor-HHS bill, which we have for the last several 
years in producing the bill. While we have differences of opinion on 
issues, there is no difference of opinion on the shared values that we 
have in providing opportunity and creating opportunity for the people 
of this country. So I thank the gentleman very, very much.
  For 2021, the Labor-HHS bill includes $196.5 billion in overall 
funding. It is an increase of $2.4 billion above the 2020 enacted 
level, $20.8 billion above the President's 2021 budget request.
  The bill supports some of our Nation's most critical programs from 
early Head Start, Social Security, CDC, and NIH. They touch individuals 
and families throughout their lives and help to create that opportunity 
to allow America to realize its values and its promise.
  The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee also continues to be central to our response to COVID-19. 
We are at the center of this health and economic crisis and the serious 
racial and economic disparities that it has exposed.
  Since March, we have appropriated $280 billion in emergency funding 
for education, for health, and for working people throughout the 
pandemic. We add $300 billion more in the HEROES bill: $197 billion in 
health, $100 billion in education, and $3.1 billion in labor.
  Today we seek to build on those emergency and supplemental packages 
so that we can be making it safe for our economy to reopen.
  Our Members recognize the importance of this bill. The subcommittee 
received more than 15,000 requests for today's bill, and I am proud to 
say that we were able to fill so many of them either in total or in 
part, and that is from both sides of the aisle.
  Let me provide a brief overview.
  Together, we are making investments for the Nation for health, 
education, good-paying safe and secure jobs, and to address the 
disparities that have been exposed by this virus:
  For health, $96 billion for programs at the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, an increase in $1.5 billion above 2020. That is a 
$500 million increase for the NIH and a $230 million increase for the 
CDC.
  For families, children, and seniors, we provide $150 million more for 
Head Start, $100 million more for childcare, $25 million more for 
preschool development grants, and $25 million more for the Low Income 
Home Energy Assistance Program.
  For education, a $716 million increase from 2020. That includes $254 
million for title 1 education for the disadvantaged, $194 million more 
for IDEA State grants for special education, $150 more for a maximum 
Pell grant, and $50 million more for minority-serving higher education 
institutions.
  As the school year approaches, while the White House chooses to make 
that a political battle to threaten schools and teachers, instead of 
beating them down, we are lifting them up to invest in them so that 
they can meet the education and the life challenges that face them.
  For working Americans, this bill provides an increase for the 
Department of Labor of $254 million, $12.7 billion in total.
  When unemployment remains at alarming high levels, we are investing 
in job opportunity and worker protection with $50 million for more 
workforce innovation and opportunity grants.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DeLauro) an additional 30 seconds.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, there is $12 million more for Job Corps and 
a $15 million increase for worker protection programs.
  We plan future investments for our public health agencies in an 
emergency, $24.4 billion; for the CDC, $9 billion; NIH, $5 billion; for 
BARDA, $4.5 billion.
  Mr. Speaker, we are going to look at ensuring oversight on these 
dollars so that the scientists are in charge and not the politicians.

                              {time}  1115

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again 
expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to move boldly, swiftly. 
Let's defeat the virus and the racial disparities it has exposed in 
health, education, and the economy. We can and must do so by passing 
the bill before us, and I urge my colleagues to invest in our 
constituents, invest in beating this virus, and closing those gaps it 
has exposed. We need to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I will miss my colleagues, Mr. Visclosky, Mr. Serrano, 
Mr. Graves, Mrs. Roby, and Mr. Hurd. It has been an honor to serve with 
them. And to our staff in the majority: Brad Allen, Jared Bass, 
Jennifer Cama, Robin Juliano, Jackie Kilroy, Laurie Mignone, Stephen 
Steigleder, and Philip Tizzani. And my personal staff: Letty Mederos, 
Liz Albertine, and Caitlin Peruccio. I thank Ranking Member Granger, 
and to Shalanda Young and to Chris Bigelow for all of the help you 
provided us during this period of time.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from California, (Mr. Calvert), my very good friend, the 
ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to the 
defense appropriations division of H.R. 7617.
  However, first, I thank the full committee chairwoman, Nita Lowey, 
for her dedicated leadership and years of service to the Committee on 
Appropriations and to this institution.
  I also extend my deep gratitude to Chairman Visclosky, who has been a 
great partner on the committee and a friend these many years. You will 
both be very much missed, and I wish you all the happiness in your next 
chapter.
  I also thank our full committee ranking member, Kay Granger, for her 
leadership on this bill. She has been a tireless advocate for our men 
and women in uniform.
  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today provides funding for many key 
programs consistent with the National Defense Strategy and is focused 
on great power competition with China and Russia.
  The bill makes critical investments in 5th generation combat 
aircraft, ships, and an additional Virginia-class submarine, while also 
providing the combatant commanders the resources necessary to carry out 
their missions. The bill also continues to invest in research and 
development of new technologies essential to maintaining U.S. military 
superiority.
  I am also pleased at the focus on providing for the health and 
welfare of our men and women in uniform. It reflects the longstanding 
concerns that so many of our members have had with defense health 
programs; sexual assault prevention, suicide prevention, and a long-
awaited electronic health record.
  These are all examples of critical investments in this bill that I 
strongly support. That is why it is so unfortunate that important 
initiatives that have broad support are overshadowed by political 
issues.
  While this is a very strong bill, there are numerous provisions, like 
the prohibition on funding for the southwest border wall construction 
and limitations on DOD's general and special transfer authorities that 
will draw a veto threat from the administration. It is important that 
the bill becomes law as soon as possible.
  While I cannot support it in its current form, I am committed to 
working with the majority to produce a bill that can be signed by the 
President.
  The importance of getting a bill done on time cannot be overstated. 
According to a DOD comptroller, a continuing resolution wastes roughly 
$1.7 billion a month. $1.7 billion a month wasted. This year, a CR 
would halt many of the modernization priorities that are vital to 
maintaining our military superiority over near-peer threats, such as

[[Page H4118]]

China and Russia. This is no way to run the most sophisticated and 
professional fighting force in the world.
  There are currently over 200,000 U.S. servicemembers deployed around 
the world, ensuring that threats never meet our shores. They do their 
job every day; there is no allowance for pause or break. They do what 
we ask, and it is time for Congress to do what is necessary and 
required in the U.S. Constitution and provide for the common defense of 
our Nation in a timely and consistent manner.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank the staff, both minority and 
majority staff, for their hard work during some very challenging times.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the hardworking 
chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, a woman with 
endless patience and expertise who has worked with dozens of groups who 
have such definite ideas on this bill.
  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7617, and I 
commend the chairs of the subcommittees who worked so hard to produce 
funding bills that reflect our ``For the People'' vision for America.
  The appropriation bills in this minibus provide critical resources 
for our wide range of vital domestic and defense priorities. As vice 
chair of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, I will focus on that title of the 
bill which, thanks to the efforts of Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and 
Ranking Member Cole, upholds our promise to Americans by investing in 
our workers' needs, supporting the education of our children, and 
ensuring all our families and communities have access to quality health 
programs during this pandemic and beyond.
  For example, the bill makes strong investments to strengthen the 
ability of our public health system to overcome the current COVID 
crisis, and equally important, to have the resources to build the 
infrastructure critical to our ability to successfully address 
public health challenges in the future.

  Robust investments are also made to address the health disparities 
COVID-19 has intensified, and the bill commissions a National Academies 
of Sciences study on the most promising solutions to advance health 
equity in the years ahead.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the Labor-HHS bill contains substantial 
funding for many of my requests to support mothers and babies during 
this pandemic and the months to follow. This includes large increases 
to the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and the Healthy 
Start program, as well as strong investments in breastfeeding support 
and a maternal mental health hotline.
  Today, our children and families are suffering from the prolonged 
isolation of school closures and the challenges of learning remotely 
while parents try to work. As we fight the pandemic, this bill makes 
critical investments to ensure our children safely receive a high-
quality education.
  During a time when so many Americans have lost jobs due to the 
economic impact of this pandemic, the strong outlays in job training 
and apprenticeships will help American workers gain the skills needed 
to get well-paying jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Biden has said, ``Don't tell me what you 
value. Show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value.''
  I thank Chairmen Visclosky, Serrano, Quigley, and Price, and 
Chairwomen Kaptur and DeLauro, for outlining those values so clearly in 
their appropriations bill, and I urge passage of this minibus.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), my very good friend and 
classmate.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Chairwoman 
Lowey and Ranking Member Granger for their leadership.
  A lot has been said about Chairwoman Lowey, and I don't want to 
repeat myself, but the bottom line is: You are one class act, and you 
will be sorely missed by this institution.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Price for his friendship, his 
transparency, and his openness in this process. I strongly support so 
many aspects of the T-HUD portion of this bill. I am particularly 
pleased with the inclusion of funding and language requests from 
Members on both sides of the aisle in a nonpartisan way.
  I appreciate, for example, the $300 million for port infrastructure 
grants. It is important, obviously, for coastal States like Florida, 
but also for our entire country's freight network, and our economy. It 
is clear that ports are crucial for our economy.
  The bill also includes $389 million for a Maritime Academy Training 
Ship program--something that had been, frankly, ignored for too many 
years. This bill supports the training ship in Texas, which will double 
as a disaster response asset for the region.
  The bill continues investments in our Nation's highways, rail, 
transit and airport infrastructure. It builds on progress we have made 
in recent years through, again, this bill creating jobs, improving the 
quality of life, and spurring innovation. The bill makes important 
progress to enhance safety on our roads and railways.
  Now, these are programs championed for years by Chairwoman Lowey, 
and, obviously, Chairman Price. And I share her support in these areas, 
but, again, this has been her driving force.
  Funding for FAA will modernize air traffic technologies, improve the 
safety of our skies, and address noise concerns from our colleagues in 
our communities.
  The bill renews housing assistance for millions of Americans in need. 
It is our duty. It is our duty to meet this commitment, especially for 
our elderly, for our disabled, for our heroes, for our veterans. These 
housing assistance programs are not just a safety net for millions of 
Americans, but they are a path for opportunity and self-sufficiency to 
so many.
  Chairman Price has included new innovative programs to support our 
efforts to end homelessness in America, including a focus on families 
at risk of becoming homeless, victims of domestic violence, and 
veterans.
  Again, Chairman Price has made so many smart and, by the way, tough 
decisions, but smart, good policy decisions that I, unfortunately, like 
my colleagues, find it unfortunate that I cannot support this bill in 
its current form right now.
  A major portion of this T-HUD bill division is based on, frankly, a 
funding gimmick--$75 billion in new infrastructure spending is 
designated as an emergency. This violates last year's bipartisan 
agreement. It puts our entire appropriations process at risk. The bill 
also includes controversial DOT and HUD policy riders. Some of these 
were dropped last year, again, consistent with the budget agreement 
that we all--most of us--voted for. And they have to be dropped again.
  Despite these concerns and, obviously, despite the fact that at this 
moment I can't support the bill, I need to thank Chairman Price for 
making, again, as I mentioned, some really, really good important 
decisions. He had to make some tough decisions. That is what this job 
entails when you are an appropriator and you are a cardinal, but he has 
done so.
  Mr. Speaker, I am confident--no, I am certain--that we will be able 
to address these concerns as this process moves forward. Chairman Price 
knows how to reach across the aisle and how to strike a deal, as does 
our committee leadership, Chairwoman Lowey, and our ranking member, as 
well.
  The question is not ``if,'' but ``when'' we will be able to get a 
bill that can be sent to the President and will be able to get his 
signature. Again, this bill isn't that right now, but I am confident 
that we will be able to move forward.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and 
friend, Chairwoman Lowey.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, particularly the 
division involving Transportation, HUD appropriations for fiscal year 
2021.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and the former chairman of our 
subcommittee, Mario Diaz-Balart, for his kind words this morning and 
for his cooperation throughout this process. We

[[Page H4119]]

do work well together, and we share many, many goals for this 
legislation. We have a bill that reflects that collaborative work.
  My heartfelt best wishes to Chairwoman Lowey. Your leadership has 
been exceptional, as many have said--your friendship, even more so. We 
are going to miss you, and we are happy to see these tributes today. 
And also, to other retiring Members: Mr. Visclosky, Mr. Serrano, Mr. 
Graves; all colleagues who have contributed greatly, and whom we will 
miss.

                              {time}  1130

  This year's T-HUD appropriations bill represents a renewed commitment 
to address our Nation's housing crisis and to modernize our aging 
transportation infrastructure. Throughout the bill, we focus on 
improved safety, on the needs of underserved people and communities, 
and on resiliency in the face of a changing climate.
  Overall, the bill includes $75.9 billion in discretionary funding. 
That is an increase of $1.6 billion over the Fiscal Year 2020 level, 
and it is $16.7 billion above the President's budget request. It also 
includes major increases for highway and transit formula funding, 
consistent with Chairman DeFazio's INVEST Act, which passed the House 
on July 1, 2020.
  On the housing side of the ledger, we provide increases of $100 
million for the Community Development Block Grant program and $350 
million for HOME, to help spur the creation of new affordable housing.
  We fully renew all Housing Choice Vouchers. We provide $250 million 
for new vouchers targeting homeless families and those at risk of 
homelessness, and we increase homeless assistance grants by 
approximately 23 percent over last year's level. That is the largest 
increase in over a decade.
  Our bill includes an 11 percent increase in the Public Housing 
Capital Fund and new set-asides within that fund to address urgent 
health and safety issues. We continue to provide new resources to 
create more housing for the elderly and disabled and for the Choice 
Neighborhoods program, formerly known as HOPE VI.
  The bill also does right by transportation. All modes receive robust 
funding, including highways, transit, rail, aviation, bike and 
pedestrian projects, and ports.
  This includes $1 billion for the popular BUILD program; more than $2 
billion for Amtrak; a very deliberate 50 percent increase for intercity 
passenger and freight rail improvements in the CRISI program; and a 
funding boost for highways, bus fleet replacement, and the Federal 
Transit Administration's Capital Investment Grants, or ``New Starts'' 
transit program.
  This division of the bill also includes emergency funds. It provides 
an additional $75 billion for infrastructure investments to revitalize 
transportation networks, jump-start affordable housing production, and 
further reduce the disgraceful public housing capital backlog.
  Some may object to this use of emergency spending, but to them I ask: 
What is the cost of continued inaction for our economy, for our 
communities? ``Infrastructure Week'' shouldn't be a punch line. We need 
to mean it. This funding is necessary for our future prosperity, 
especially as we transition from this pandemic to recovery.
  I want to underscore that the funding in the bill deliberately 
promotes equity and resiliency in our communities. We set aside funding 
for areas of persistent poverty, provide dedicated funding for DOT and 
HUD to offer technical assistance, especially to rural and low-income 
areas, and to fund programs that promote opportunity.
  The bill seeks to protect taxpayer dollars by incorporating 
resiliency principles into DOT and HUD programs. That means building 
smarter, requiring all-hazards mitigation, and the use of updated 
building codes.
  Importantly, the bill prevents HUD from implementing mean-spirited 
and harmful rules that would split up immigrant families in Federally 
assisted housing and allow homeless shelters to discriminate against 
LGBTQ individuals.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. The bill also provides increased funds 
for fair housing enforcement, which is all the more important given 
HUD's open hostility to bedrock fair housing laws and the President's 
racist tweet, just yesterday, about low-income housing in suburban 
communities. Pending amendments will go one step further in preventing 
Donald Trump from repealing our fair housing rules.
  So, Mr. Speaker, this year's T-HUD bill incorporates many priorities 
from Members on both sides of the aisle, makes forward-looking 
investments in our housing and transportation infrastructure, boosts 
safety, protects vulnerable population, and promotes equity and 
fairness.
  I want to thank our excellent professional staff: Joe Carlile, our 
majority clerk; his teammates Gladys Barcena, Winnie Chang, Jo Eckert, 
Sarah Puro, Angela Ohm, and Becky Salay; our minority clerk, Doug 
Disrud, and his colleague, Alyssa Hinman. I want to thank Sean Maxwell 
from my personal staff and Chris Sweet from Mr. Diaz-Balart's personal 
staff. They work hard, and we appreciate that hard work.
  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  To respond to my friend, I have no problems whatsoever with emergency 
spending. That is why we passed four bills. We work with our friends on 
the other side of the aisle to do that.
  I think where the mistake was made was the HEROES Act, where you 
decided you weren't going to work with anybody on this side of the 
aisle. You just jammed it through, and it has gotten nowhere in the 
United States Senate.
  The same thing is happening here. This emergency spending of enormous 
proportion that has been placed in this bill was done without any 
consultation with Republicans in the House, let alone with agreements 
with the Senate and the President, who would have to sign off on it. I 
don't think that is a productive way to proceed. I think negotiating 
together with one another, we show we can work together.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington 
(Mrs. Rodgers), a distinguished lady from Spokane, Washington, my good 
friend, and a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee.

  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
bill. While it contains many partisan poison pills and reckless levels 
of spending, there is a glaring omission: funding for the long-term 
storage of nuclear waste.
  Safely storing our Nation's existing and future nuclear waste in 
Yucca Mountain is of paramount importance. Eastern Washington pioneered 
some of the most important breakthroughs in nuclear technology of the 
last century at the Hanford Site near Tri-Cities, Washington. Their 
efforts are critical to continuing the development and the expansion of 
nuclear power in the next century.
  However, this important work came at a cost. Today, more than 2,000 
tons of spent nuclear waste and millions of gallons of high-level waste 
await disposal at the Hanford Site, which is why it is so necessary 
that we move forward with the Yucca Mountain site and properly dispose 
of the nuclear waste in eastern Washington and from the sites in 38 
other States across the country.
  The United States has led the world in nuclear energy innovation, and 
continued advancements in this important technology will be essential 
to meet our clean energy needs and maintain our global leadership in 
the 21st century.
  Failure to move forward with the Yucca Mountain site jeopardizes our 
ability to continue to innovate in the future and is unfair to the 
communities that have dealt with the cost of housing nuclear waste for 
the past 50 years.
  I would like to end by thanking Congressman Shimkus for his years of 
tireless leadership on this important issue. Whether shepherding 
legislation through the Energy and Commerce Committee and through the 
House, prodding the Appropriations Committee to act, or leading 
delegations to see Yucca firsthand, no one has been

[[Page H4120]]

more dedicated to solving the nuclear waste issue for our Nation's 
communities.
  Let's help him finish that fight by working on a bipartisan, long-
term solution to our country's nuclear waste.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial 
Services and General Government.
  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for 
her service and for allowing me to speak today.
  I also want to thank my friend, Ranking Member   Tom Graves, who I 
now have had the privilege of working with for a fourth year managing 
this bill. He was previously chairman. He was always helpful, 
cooperative, and gracious. I thank him for his partnership throughout 
this process, and we will miss him next year.
  I would also like to thank the staff on both sides for the hard work 
that goes on behind the scenes in developing this legislation. From my 
personal office, that includes Juan and Bridget; and from our committee 
staff on the majority side, Laura, Marybeth, Elliott, Aalok, Parker, 
and Matt; and from our minority staff, John Martens. For the committee 
staff particularly, I know it has not been easy, as you have been 
working remotely.
  The bill before us today provides $24.64 billion in total 
discretionary funding. This is an increase of $808 million above 2020.
  We also include $67 billion in emergency funding for broadband, 
Federal buildings, and land ports of entry across the Nation.
  The FSGG bill encompasses a wide range of programs, everything from 
the IRS to the Federal courts to the District of Columbia to the 
General Services Administration.
  A longstanding priority of mine has been to help States and local 
governments meet the challenge of restoring the security and integrity 
of our elections. To this end, the bill includes $500 million for 
election security grants to help States acquire resources and equipment 
to conduct safe and secure and on-time elections.
  This issue is especially relevant now, as States are currently facing 
the need to adjust their processes to accommodate conducting an 
election in the middle of a pandemic.
  Also of importance, the FSGG bill includes $12.1 billion for the IRS, 
an increase of more than $606 million above fiscal year 2020. This is a 
good first step toward restoring the draconian cuts this agency has 
suffered for almost a decade.
  The IRS has played a critical role in the disbursement of stimulus 
checks during the height of the tax filing season. While its rollout 
has not been without its challenges, it has highlighted how important 
it is for the IRS to have proper funding.
  Notably, the bill makes significant investments in taxpayer services, 
helping to provide better resources for taxpayers, especially for low-
income individuals and the elderly, and investment to support more 
efficient and effective enforcement activities to address all 
taxpayers, including those in the higher tax brackets, as well as an 
investment in business systems modernization and to help improve their 
outdated IT and operating systems.
  The bill also ensures capital and other assistance gets to small 
businesses and those who are underbanked in low-income communities. For 
instance, we rejected the President's proposal to essentially eliminate 
the Community Development Financial Institution Fund and included 
$273.5 million for CDFIs.
  The bill also provides $277 million for the Small Business 
Administration's entrepreneurial development programs to help small 
businesses expand and grow.
  We also reject the administration's efforts to sideline funds to 
combat the opioid epidemic. We include $290 million for High Intensity 
Drug Trafficking Areas and $102 million for the Drug-Free Communities 
program.
  The bill includes $7.8 billion in discretionary appropriations for 
the judicial branch, an increase of $287 million, to fund protective 
services and physical security needs in courthouses and to ensure the 
continued operations of the Federal judiciary.

  We also increase funding for agencies to protect everyday consumers 
and retail investors: the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the 
Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  Finally, the bill takes steps toward reducing undue congressional 
interference in local D.C. affairs and eliminates restrictions on the 
District that do not apply to other parts of the Nation. Importantly, 
it ends the uniquely restrictive prohibition on the use of locally 
raised funds for abortions.
  In closing, I would like to reiterate how grateful I am to all the 
staff that helped put this product together. It is a bill we can all be 
proud of, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this 
legislation.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. Duncan), my very good friend and distinguished member and 
leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, here we go again, voting on an 
appropriations package without funding Yucca Mountain because the 
Federal Government will not follow the law passed by Congress.
  It is the law of the land to store the Nation's nuclear waste in a 
long-term repository, and Yucca Mountain is the site that was chosen by 
the Federal Government to store that.
  Now, the government wants the American people to follow the mandates 
recommended by the CDC, but they won't follow a duly-passed law. Let's 
be clear: It doesn't matter whether the Republicans or the Democrats 
control the House of Representatives or the White House, the law is 
ignored because of the politics of Nevada.
  The terminology the other side uses, ``The science is settled,'' 
well, the science is settled with regard to Yucca Mountain. It was 
settled a long time ago.
  It is settled with reprocessing, too. But short of that, we need to 
do something with the waste that sits beside the pristine waters of 
Lake Erie, the Savannah River, Lake Keowee in my district, and 
waterways all across this great land.

                              {time}  1145

  I have got a question for my colleagues, Republican and Democrat: How 
much have the utility rate payers in your State forked out for nothing? 
Nothing.
  I can tell you, in South Carolina, it is over $3 billion. I can tell 
you that nationwide, it is about $40 billion.
  And, folks, we are not just talking about spent fuel, which sits at 
121 sites in 39 States. There is also yucky stuff sitting at Savannah 
River site, Idaho Flats and Oak Ridge and Hanford, Washington, that has 
been turned to glass.
  Let's put that glass and the spent fuel where the Nation decided by 
law that we should put that, and that is Yucca Mountain.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the vice chair of the Commerce, Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
combination of appropriations bills, this minibus.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss this CJS 
component of the bill.
  First, I would like to thank, again, our overall chairwoman of 
appropriations for her amazing dignified service in the Congress and to 
the Appropriations Committee.
  I also want to express my appreciation to Chairman Jose Serrano, 
whose leadership of CJS has been unmatched.
  Thank you to the staff, Bob Bonner, Jeff Ashford, T.J. Lowdermilk, 
Shannon McCully, B.G. Wright, Faye Cobb, Trisha Castaneda, and also 
acknowledge the good faith and the assistance of Ranking Member 
Aderholt and the minority staff as well.
  The fiscal year 2021 Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill 
includes a total of $71.473 billion in discretionary budget authority, 
which is actually a $1.7 billion decrease below last year's level. This 
reflects the natural decline in the funding requirement due to the 
decreased needs associated with the completion of the 2020 Census.
  But even at this overall funding level, the CJS bill sustains strong 
increases to invest in jobs and economic

[[Page H4121]]

development, reduce gun violence, address climate change, sustain 
scientific leadership in the world, and implement police accountability 
and police reform.
  On this last score, this bill takes immediate steps to start the 
process of police reform and accountability and to better protect civil 
rights. To do that, the bill increases funding for the Civil Rights 
Division of the Justice Department, as well as for the U.S. Attorney 
and the FBI to conduct pattern and practice reviews of law enforcement 
agencies. We include language to roll back Justice Department policies 
that have hindered this oversight.
  The bill provides funding for a national task force on law 
enforcement oversight and national police misconduct database.
  In addition, the bill funds nearly $500 million in new grant programs 
authorized in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. These grants 
will help improve law enforcement practices and accountability by 
funding State-level pattern and practice reviews and independent 
reviews of law enforcement, as well as funding better training for 
police community, organization efforts, and more.
  Finally, we include sensible requirements for COPS and Byrne JAG 
grants to implement numerous reform efforts at the local level. These 
changes show that the Federal Government is deeply serious about 
ensuring police accountability and protecting American civil rights.
  The bill does these things without neglecting important priorities 
elsewhere. We reject the administration's proposed cuts to climate 
change research programs at NASA and NOAA and, instead, provide 
responsible funding increases to that.
  We promote jobs and better wages by supporting significant 
investments at the Economic Development Administration, through the 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership program and the Minority Business 
Development Agency.
  We help policing against gun violence by increasing ATF's budget by 
$150 million, by sustaining funding for the NICS program and grants, 
and by increasing funding for the STOP School Violence Act.
  We promote criminal justice reform with large increases for both the 
First Step Act and the Second Chance Act, and we increase funding to 
address the ongoing opioid epidemic.
  This bill also ensures that our Nation's scientific leadership in the 
world can continue by increasing funding by $270 million for the 
National Science Foundation, by $35 million for the core NIST 
activities, and by over $101 million for NOAA.
  We also include significant funding for the educational components of 
NASA, National Science Foundation, and NOAA to ensure that we are 
training the next generation of scientists in America to continue this 
important work.
  Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, and more, I urge the adoption of 
this minibus.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire from my friend, is she 
prepared to close?
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, yes, I am.
  Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to begin where every other speaker has started, 
and that is to thank our distinguished chairman for her 30 years of 
unparalleled service to the Congress and to the country and, of course, 
her many years on Appropriations.
  I have had the good fortune since I arrived on that committee to 
serve with my friend and watch her steady rise to the chairmanship. And 
I think my friend, Mr. Diaz-Balart, summed it up, if you want to be 
short: What a class act.
  What an extraordinary appropriator. We all, on both sides of the 
aisle, respect her professionalism and her deep knowledge of the 
appropriations process. But I think even more than that, we just 
appreciate her personal qualities as a friend, as a mentor, as a 
colleague, and as someone who is an outstanding credit to her district, 
to her State, and to the Congress of the United States. Mr. Speaker, we 
will all miss her on both sides of the aisle.

  Having said that, I am going to be less charitable toward the bill 
itself.
  As I mentioned several times, I love the Appropriations Committee 
because I think it is a naturally collaborative committee, and when it 
is left to do its work, it does a really good job.
  Last year, we had a negotiated settlement between the President and 
the congressional leadership on both sides of the aisle in both 
Chambers in the 2019 Budget Act, and that led to a very orderly 
appropriations process under the leadership of my friend, the chairman.
  We got all those bills done. We didn't have a long-term CR, and we 
have not been at risk, in this fiscal year, of a government shutdown. 
And that is something you can't always say around here.
  My friend had a great deal to do with that, along with our ranking 
member, Ms. Granger, that legendary partnership between the two. If you 
let them do their work, they will get the job done.
  What is in front of us now, though, is not what we saw last year. My 
friends, for whatever reason, decided they would ignore the 2019 Budget 
Act, which has the force of law, and embark on an unprecedented amount 
of emergency spending, almost a quarter of a trillion dollars. And, 
again, none of that was agreed to last year.
  In addition, last year, the agreement was we would not put extraneous 
matters in the bill. We would not put legislative riders, as they are 
known. We didn't do it last year, and we moved through. This year, 
these bills are absolutely full of them. And the consequence, while 
these bills may pass this floor, they are certainly not going to be 
taken up as is by the United States Senate, nor would they ever be 
signed by the President.
  I think we have another model. We have the model of last year. We 
also have the model of the first four supplementals this year, Mr. 
Speaker. The four supplementals dealing with coronavirus were brought 
to the floor after collaborative discussion and negotiation and passed 
here with almost universal bipartisan support on each occasion.
  For whatever reason, rather than continuing that productive dialogue, 
our friend decided they would bring the HEROES Act. That is certainly 
their right to do that. But, again, if you are not involving 
Republicans in this Chamber in that discussion, then I can assure you 
you are not going to be in very good shape when you go to a Chamber 
where Republicans are actually the majority. Nor will you get the 
support of the President. And we are seeing how that is working out 
right now with respect to the next supplemental. The same thing could 
happen here.
  Mr. Speaker, I don't worry about that in the short term because, 
again, there are times in this process where it is partisan, and when 
we get to conference, quite often, it becomes bipartisan. But I do 
worry these departures are so large that we could find ourselves in 
September kicking into a CR and then, frankly, then we could do another 
one well into next year. That would be a mistake. That would be a 
mistake, in my opinion.
  The day-to-day funding of government ought to go on regardless of the 
politics of the moment. The emergencies need to be dealt with. And I 
think we have shown we can work together on emergency supplementals. We 
did them so quickly and so easily in an unprecedented way just in the 
spring of this year. So I would think we could return to that.
  And if we do return to that, I suspect our friends and I on our side 
can come to common ground and we can bring bills to the floor that 
command substantial bipartisan majorities, just as my friend, the 
chairwoman, did last year when she brought appropriations bill after 
bill after bill to the floor, and they were passed with substantial 
bipartisan majorities because she engaged, as is always her habit, in 
collaborative negotiation with friends on all sides of the Chamber.
  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly urge the rejection of this 
particular minibus of six appropriations bills. I hope that my friends, 
as we go forward, will return to their habits in terms of the 
appropriations of last year and return to the style of negotiation that 
they exhibited all through the spring in dealing with this awful 
coronavirus crisis that has caused such turmoil and damage in our 
country.
  In closing, the last thing I would say is, again, it is a privilege 
for me to

[[Page H4122]]

share the floor with my friend, the chairman. Normally, my ranking 
member would be here, but Ms. Granger, of course, is in self-quarantine 
because of coronavirus; otherwise, I know she would prefer to be here. 
But her misfortune at least gave me the opportunity to share the floor 
with my very good friend, our distinguished chairman.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the rejection of the legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I do want to say to my dear friend, Mr. Cole, that I 
will truly miss you. We have worked together on so many issues, and not 
only are you thoughtful, intelligent, and enthusiastic, but you are a 
real partner.
  And I am not sure what the future brings for any of us, but let's 
hope that this coronavirus disappears somehow soon. I hope my friend, 
Ms. Granger, does not, frankly, suffer from it, and I am glad that she 
is going through a period of isolation. Let's hope there is some good 
news. But, for me, it has really been a pleasure not only to work with 
you, but to be your friend.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very, very kind remarks.
  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the work we have completed under 
incredibly difficult circumstances, and I would like to thank our 
wonderful subcommittee chairs, particularly Pete Visclosky and Jose 
Serrano, who are also retiring. I thank them both for their outstanding 
service.
  This is an excellent package of appropriation bills that lives up to 
the principle that has guided our work together: Do the best we can to 
make life better for the most people we can.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, before I begin with my remarks on the 
fiscal year (FY) 2021 bill, I would like to briefly discuss some 
concerns I have as a longtime member of the House Appropriations 
Committee.
  The Committee has a unique responsibility. It is charged with funding 
and oversight of the entire government, and ensuring that it is as 
effective and as efficient as possible. However, in some ways, the 
Committee is at its nadir in terms of its ability to achieve bipartisan 
solutions. In part, this is due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, 
which is an ill-fated attempt to balance the federal budget by cutting 
only discretionary spending.
  Currently, mandatory spending and interest on the debt represent 70 
percent of the money spent each year by the federal government. 
Discretionary spending, which is an investment in the future, makes up 
just 30 percent of federal spending. When less than 30 percent of young 
Americans are qualified to join the military, it is clear we need to 
invest more in our nation's health, education, infrastructure, and 
jobs. Unfortunately, from my perspective, recent Congresses have 
mistakenly relied on mandatory spending to avoid making difficult 
decisions on discretionary spending on an annual basis. A case in 
point, last week the House passed a bill that will provide much needed 
funding to address the maintenance backlog in our public lands. But the 
bill utilizes mandatory funding mechanisms that further decrease the 
ability of Congress and the Appropriations Committee to exercise annual 
discretion and oversight.
  I implore my colleagues who serve in the next Congress to avoid 
repeating the mistakes of the recent past. The lasting solution to our 
nation's fiscal problems will only be realized by confronting the 
continued growth in mandatory spending while simultaneously increasing 
revenues. In the year 2000, the last year the federal government had a 
surplus, revenues, as a percentage of GDP, were 20 percent. In fiscal 
year 2019, revenues were 16.3 percent. We need revenue to invest in the 
future of our country, and every appropriated dollar is an investment.
  Moving onto the FY 2021 bill, I first want to thank my Ranking Member 
and friend, Mr. Calvert, for his continued commitment to being 
collegial, transparent, and bipartisan. I cannot overstate the value of 
his friendship and the partnership we have enjoyed over the years.
  I also want to express my sincere gratitude to Chairwoman Lowey and 
Ranking Member Granger. We would not be here without their leadership 
and dedication.
  Further, I would like to acknowledge that Chairwoman Lowey will be 
joining me in departing the House at the end of this year. I commend 
her for a dedicated life of service and commitment to leaving this 
world a little bit better than the way she found it. I thank her very 
much. It is a joy to work with her.
  I want to thank the Subcommittee staff, particularly, our clerks, 
Becky Leggieri and Johnnie Kaberle, as well as Walter Hearne, Brooke 
Barnard, Ariana Sarar, Jackie Ripke, David Bortnick, Matt Bower, Bill 
Adkins, Jennifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, Paul Kilbride, Shannon 
Richter, Sherry Young, Kyle McFarland, Kiya Batmanglidj, Jamie 
McCormick, Brian Potts, and Nick Vance, my personal office staff, Joe 
DeVooght and Stephen Cash, and those in Ranking Member Calvert's 
personal office, Rebecca Keightley and William Hendrickson. Having to 
assemble the bulk of the bill and report remotely increased the degree 
of difficulty substantially, as it has for all of the subcommittees. I 
commend them for their professionalism and acumen.
  The bill would provide $694.6 billion for the Department of Defense 
budget, which is $1.3 billion above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level 
and $3.7 billion below the request. The base funding recommendation is 
$626.2 billion, which is $3.5 billion above the fiscal year 2020 
enacted level and $3.5 billion below the request. The overseas 
contingency operations recommendation is $68.4 billion, which is $2.2 
billion below the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $215 million below 
the request.
  This legislation recognizes the complex challenges the members of our 
Armed Forces and intelligence community face every day throughout the 
world, and it aims to ensure that they are able to continue to meet 
these challenges and complete their missions to the best of their 
abilities. To support this forward-looking posture, the bill makes 
major investments in operations and maintenance, procurement, and 
research and development.
  I also think it is important to highlight some investments the 
Committee has made with regards to the current COVID-19 pandemic. This 
legislation would provide:
  $758 million in procurement for COVID-19 recovery for second, third 
and fourth tier suppliers. This has been of particular interest to Mr. 
Calvert, and I appreciate his advocacy of this issue;
  $450 million in operation and maintenance for COVID-19 recovery and 
resupply; and
  $150 million in the Defense Health Program for COVID-19 response.
  In addition to the funding enumerated above, the legislation places 
several reporting requirements on the Department specific to COVID-19. 
The budgetary impacts of the pandemic on the Department are still 
largely undetermined. Some programs will cost more. However, there will 
be savings obtained through delayed or cancelled events and activities. 
It is imperative that the Committee and Congress have as much detail as 
possible to properly delegate funding and to conduct oversight.
  And most importantly, the bill continues to focus on the well-being 
and morale of those in uniform and their families, as well as DoD 
civilians and their communities.
  The bill provides an additional $116 million for upgrades to 
childcare facilities and the report contains language directing the 
military services to present innovative ideas to address the serious 
backlog for childcare.
  The bill provides $1.49 billion for environmental restoration 
activities, which is $415 million above the request. This increased 
funding will help DoD address the significant and salient public health 
risks associated with PFOS/PFOA.
  The bill and report take steps to stop the Department from closing 
military treatment facilities and from reducing military healthcare 
billets, which would have cost $334.6 million this fiscal year. These 
plans were poorly justified to the Committee prior to the pandemic, and 
even harder to defend under current conditions.
  The bill provides $327 million to address the ongoing epidemic of 
sexual assault in the military and at the service academies, which is 
$49 million more than requested. And I must express my personal upset 
over this issue. The most recent report on the sexual assault rate for 
women has jumped a shocking 50 percent from 2016 to 2018. Despite dire 
warnings, the Department's budget for sexual assault prevention and 
response remains stagnant. And I would also say it is not just a 
question of money. Year after year after year, we have testimony from 
officials who contend that they are really committed to solving this 
problem. And yet we are going backwards. The Department must do a much 
better job.
  These efforts and several others within the bill will have an 
immediate positive impact on people's quality of life.
  Another area of concern for me is the Department's lack of compliance 
with many Congressionally directed reporting requirements. For example, 
last year the Committee directed the Department to submit a report on 
its contracts for advertising services with socially and economically 
disadvantaged small businesses. The report was supposed to accompany 
the Department's FY 2021 budget submission in February, but it was 
transmitted to the Committee on July 14, five months late and the same 
day we marked up the bill. Regrettably, reporting deadlines are often 
missed, making it much more difficult for the Committee to make timely 
decisions.

[[Page H4123]]

  The bill, again, contains several provisions to rein in the 
Department's habitual redirection of funding and contravention of 
congressional intent. These actions have irreparably damaged the 
Department's credibility with the Committee. One DoD official, in a 
meeting, referred to these transfers of billions of dollars as 
anomalies. I refer to them as habitual abuses by the Department.
  In recent years, the Department leadership has not missed an 
opportunity to claim that a 3 percent to 5 percent annual growth rate 
in the defense budget is necessary to support the National Defense 
Strategy. But at the same time, those same leaders facilitated the 
transfer of nearly $10 billion to non-defense activities not enumerated 
in their own National Defense Strategy. And while this was happening, 
they also have the temerity to repeatedly request more flexibility from 
Congress for executing their budget and for reprogramming authorities. 
The sense of entitlement in these actions is galling, and I hope that 
at some point the Department will have the leadership in place to 
recognize Congress's constitutional prerogative and restore trust to 
the appropriations process.
  In closing, I would again thank my chair, ranking member, and all of 
the members, who have logged so many hours in making this bill 
possible. I look forward to debate on the amendments.
  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, as the Republican leader of the 
Appropriations Committee, I oppose H.R. 7617, the second package of 
fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills to be considered by the House.
  My concerns today will sound very familiar. I had many of the same 
objections when I spoke on the House floor last week about the first 
package of appropriations bills.
  I regret that I again oppose a very important piece of legislation.
  This bill supports:
  The servicemembers who risk it all for our freedoms;
  The law enforcement officers that keep us safe;
  The small business owners who want to achieve the American dream;
  The researchers seeking groundbreaking cures for diseases;
  The ports and waterways that are so critical for commerce; and
  Our transit systems that millions of Americans rely on every day.
  Unfortunately, like the bill we considered last week, H.R. 7617 has 
some fatal flaws that make it unacceptable.
  First, many of the policy provisions are similar to the partisan 
legislation the majority has pushed through the house the last few 
months; and second, the spending levels exceed the amounts the Congress 
and the President agreed to just last year.
  Instead of policy and funding proposals being developed from the 
bottom up within the Appropriations Committee, many of these decisions 
appear to have been dictated from the top down.
  This is disappointing because the committee has held more than 100 
hearings and briefings in the last six months--even in the middle of a 
global pandemic.
  For example, the bill jeopardizes our safety and security by:
  Repealing both the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of 
military force, which would limit our ability to conduct 
counterterrorism operations worldwide;
  Allowing terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay to be brought to U.S. 
soil; and
  Preventing the United States from exercising the right to defend 
ourselves and our allies, such as Israel.
  Our path toward renewed American prominence in space is undermined, 
giving China the opportunity to dominate the next frontier.
  The bill gives in to the voices calling for de-funding the police by 
failing to provide adequate funding for our federal law enforcement 
agencies.
  In addition, state and local law enforcement agencies are prohibited 
from receiving excess equipment from the Department of Defense.
  Officers should have what they need to protect and serve our 
communities. Provisions in this bill will halt critical funds used for 
training and equipment, including active shooter training, body 
cameras, and bullet-proof vests.
  The bill also:
  Blocks the administration's rule protecting health care providers 
from performing actions that violate their religious beliefs;
  Forces faith-based providers to discuss abortion, even if they have a 
personal objection; and
  Perhaps worst of all, makes changes to family planning grants which 
will require funds to go to Planned Parenthood clinics.
  I am also disappointed to see that several long-standing, bipartisan 
second amendment protections were eliminated.
  The bill also contains billions of dollars in emergency spending on 
top of the caps that were agreed to last year.
  $186 billion is included in this bill for infrastructure without any 
bipartisan discussions or agreement.
  Another $24 billion is included to address coronavirus, even though a 
three trillion-dollar bill passed the House in May and the Senate is 
moving quickly on its response.
  We must work together on appropriations bills that avoid 
controversial legislative language and meet agreed-upon spending 
levels.
  This is the only way to get bills through the House and the Senate 
and signed into law.
  For these reasons, I oppose this package.
  Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note provisions in 
H.R. 7617 which provide $5 million for the Maglev Deployment Program, 
also known as MDP, and an additional $100 million in Title V of the 
bill.
  The MDP was created in 1998 as a competitive program to encourage the 
development and construction of an operating maglev transportation 
system capable of safe use by the public at speeds in excess of 240 
miles per hour. The program was not intended for the United States to 
deploy a new transportation system somewhere in America and not for 
research. America has fallen behind as countries like China and Japan 
have deployed magnetic levitation transportation systems.
  Congress directed the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to 
establish project selection criteria, to solicit applications for 
funding, to select one or more projects to receive financial assistance 
for preconstruction planning activities, and after completion of such 
activities, to select one of the projects to receive financial 
assistance for final design, engineering and construction. Funds were 
only available to States or an Authority designated by one or more 
States and included required State matching funds.
  The FRA received eleven applications for MDP funding and selected 
seven projects for Initial Feasibility Studies. The FRA then completed 
a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision 
for the MDP.
  As a result of the prior rounds, the FRA further selected two 
projects to continue: Baltimore-Washington and Pittsburgh. Other 
projects in the Program, such as Atlanta-Chattanooga, could continue 
but without federal support.
  In 2008, Congress passed SAFETEA-LU providing an additional $90 
million in Highway Trust Fund contract authority for the MDP. In 
clarifying eligible projects for the MDP Congress explained that for 
projects east of the Mississippi River ``the intent is to limit the 
eligible projects to three existing projects east of the Mississippi 
River: Pittsburgh, Baltimore-Washington and Atlanta-Chattanooga.''
  Subsequently, the Pittsburgh project was discontinued, leaving the 
Atlanta-Chattanooga and the Baltimore-Washington projects as the two 
remaining in the competition. In 2019, the Georgia DOT determined to 
not pursue Atlanta-Chattanooga any further.
  As a result, after 20 years of work, more than $100 million of 
private sector investment, millions of dollars in state and federal 
investment, the most advanced and sophisticated of the projects has 
emerged as the winner. All of the participants have expended time and 
funds in reliance on the fact that the longstanding competitive process 
would ultimately end in the selection and, hopefully, construction sofa 
single project.
  It is critical that the federal commitment continue. I applaud the 
Committee and Congress for its continued federal commitment to the MDP. 
After so many years of monetary and time investment, by many 
participants, the good faith effort by the State of Maryland and the 
Maryland private sector should result in the purpose the competitive 
program was designed to achieve. Congressional intent has never 
changed. Indeed, the Baltimore-Washington Project has attracted 
potentially billions of dollars in nonfederal investment.
  I rise to make it abundantly clear, as Congress did in 2008, that 
funds in the MDP are available only to current participants in the 
program, and it is not the intent of this Congress to restart a 20 year 
competition to new entrants, after so much work, reliance on the 
process and expenditure. It is clear to this Member that FRA discretion 
to award funds is limited to those existing projects in the Maglev 
Deployment Program.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the need for a 
backup system to GPS, which is critical to our economy, our national 
security and is integrated into nearly every aspect of all Americans 
lives. We greatly appreciate the foresight of the Appropriations 
Committee for providing $5,000,000 in funding to begin the 
implementation of the National Timing Resilience and Security Act under 
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology at 
the Department of Transportation.
  The need for a backup system to GPS has been recognized by this 
government for over 15 years and a terrestrial based system has been 
recommended nearly 18 times by different US government agencies and 
bodies in the last decade alone. Because of this is, in

[[Page H4124]]

2018 Congress acted in a fully bipartisan manner to finally protect GPS 
by passing the National Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2018. 
Unanimously approved in the House, and by 96 to 4 in the Senate, it was 
signed into law on December 4, 2018. This law calls for, at a minimum, 
the deployment of a terrestrial based backup system for GPS with the 
Department of Transportation as the lead for execution. This Jaw 
ensures the implementation of a nationwide, fully complementary, and 
resilient backup timing system within two years, and thereafter with 
the expansion to position and navigation.
  As strong of an advocate for GPS as I know we all are, we must now 
also be stronger advocates for protecting it. And that comes through 
this funding for the deployment of the National Timing Resilience and 
Security Act under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research 
and Technology at the Department of Transportation.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Calvert) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, my amendment would increase and decrease 
by $5 million the NSF Research and Related Activities budget to support 
a National Academy of Sciences study on approaches and procedures for 
creating and assessing congressional district maps.
  The mathematical community has focused on the theory of district map 
drawing and can now provide fair and unbiased methods of creating and 
evaluating district maps.
  Recent court rulings have shown that objective statistical evidence 
can be

[[Page H4128]]

used to assess whether district maps have been drawn in an overly 
partisan manner. These rulings which have continually found 
congressional and State legislative districts in States across the 
country to be too partisan highlight the need for an impartial, 
unbiased system of creating and assessing district maps. My amendment 
would fund a study to define best practices for creating fair 
congressional districts and be in compliance with the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this amendment.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, 
and I rise in opposition to the Democratic en bloc amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, while there may certainly be valid adjustments 
reflecting important priorities, there are also political statements 
that have no place in the Defense appropriations bill, such as language 
insinuating that our military is being used in a way that violates the 
First Amendment.
  Make no mistake, the men and women of the United States military 
protect and defend the First Amendment along with the entire 
Constitution to which they swore an oath. It is beneath the institution 
to call their loyalty into question. As such, I urge rejection of this 
en bloc.
  Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman has no further speakers, I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, on July 21, 2020, President Trump issued a 
Presidential Memorandum to exclude undocumented immigrants from being 
counted in reapportionment for Congress.
  The Constitution explicitly requires an ``actual Enumeration'' of all 
``persons,'' imposing on the federal government the duty to count the 
``whole number of persons in each State.'' In other words, each 
person--regardless of citizenship status--must be counted. President 
Trump's plan to prohibit undocumented immigrants from being counted in 
the apportionment of Congressional seats, violates the plain text of 
both the Constitution and the governing statutes.
  I submitted an amendment to H.R. 7617 to block this effort by 
prohibiting the use of any and all federal funds to implement, 
administer, or enforce this Presidential Memorandum. Although this 
memorandum is unconstitutional, my amendment would end any confusion 
caused by the President, and avoid costly litigation.
  Mr. Speaker, immigrants have always been America's strength, and 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen how so many immigrants have 
put themselves on the front lines to help combat the coronavirus. They 
have made enormous sacrifices, working tirelessly to provide the 
critical services we need and depend on. Immigrants are part of the 
fabric of our nation, and we shall not allow them to be kicked to the 
curb by this President.
  Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to 
promote access to justice policies within the Department of Justice.
  As a former pro bona counsel, I know how important legal 
representation is for the most vulnerable members of society. My 
amendment, which would reduce and increase funds in this division by 
the same amount, aims to bring attention to the fact that the 
Department of Justice should spend appropriated funds to improve access 
to justice in the criminal and civil systems for all Americans. 
Carrying out this goal requires coordination throughout the Department 
in its litigation, policy activity, and grant making. This task was 
historically accomplished by the Department's Office of Access to 
Justice, an office that was eliminated by the Trump administration and 
I hope is re-established soon.
  In the meantime, the Department should reinvigorate its statement of 
interest and amicus brief practice reflecting focusing on the Sixth 
Amendment right to counsel to ensure it is guaranteed at the state and 
local level in the criminal context.
  In the civil context, the Department should accelerate its work to 
raise federal agencies' awareness of how civil legal aid helps advance 
a wide range of federal objectives including improved access to health 
care and housing, education and employment, family stability and public 
safety. Specifically, the Department should continue its leadership of 
the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable an interagency effort 
that I am so pleased to learn this Administration has embraced.
  A report from the Philadelphia Bar Association showed that the 
estimated return on investment for providing counsel to low income 
tenants in the city was about $12.47. That means for every dollar that 
the City of Philadelphia spent on providing legal representation to 
these individuals, it received $12.47 in return. Ensuring access to 
justice is not only the morally just thing to do, it is also a 
financially sound decision. Responding to the legal needs of victims of 
crime, people seeking employment, and servicemembers are bipartisan 
concerns that my amendment directly supports. My amendment would help 
continue these bipartisan practices and promote the Department of 
Justice's mission of ensuring justice for all.
  Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, on July 11, 2019, President Trump issued 
Executive Order 13880 after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision denying 
the citizenship question on the Census.
  The Executive Order would have directed all government departments, 
including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to share any 
information regarding citizenship that they have with the Department of 
Commerce, which operates the Census Bureau.
  It was clear that this order was another attempt to deny the rights 
and privacy of undocumented immigrants, but we could not let the 
Administration deter anyone from participating in the decennial census. 
The census is critical for vital programs to receive federal funding, 
but more importantly census data is critical for proper political 
representation of our local community.
  That is why I introduced my bill, H.R. 7291, that would nullify the 
effect of Trump's Executive Order that requires Federal agencies to 
share citizenship data. The executive order directing federal agencies 
to compile citizenship data through administrative records and merge it 
with decennial census data is a blatant effort to collect this 
information for political and discriminatory purposes.
  Recently, on July 21, 2020, President Trump issued a Presidential 
Memorandum to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted in 
reapportionment for Congress.
  The Constitution explicitly requires an ``actual Enumeration'' of all 
persons, imposing on the federal government the duty to count the 
``whole number of persons in each State.'' In other words, each 
person--regardless of citizenship status--must be counted. President 
Trump's plan to prohibit undocumented immigrants from being counted in 
the reapportionment of Congressional seats, violates the plain text of 
both the Constitution and the governing statutes.
  I submitted Horsford Amendment 23 to Division B of H.R. 7617 to block 
this effort by nullifying the effect that of the Presidential Executive 
Order that requires Federal Agencies to share citizenship data. 
Although the President's memorandum and executive order are 
unconstitutional, my amendment would send an important message to the 
President and his administration that he cannot disenfranchise whole 
communities in our Nation. This plan violates our Constitution and 
governing statute. By moving forward with my amendment, Congress is 
making it abundantly clear that the President lacks the authority to 
exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted in reapportionment 
for Congress.
  Congress compels possesses the Constitutional authority to prevent 
the President from excluding undocumented immigrants from the 
apportionment count, and the determination by this body to move forward 
with my provision will deter the President from wasting valuable public 
time and resources on an unconstitutional action.
  The contributions of immigrants are of vital importance to our 
society and economy, particularly as immigrant communities play a 
significant role as frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 
example, the American health care system relies very heavily on 
individuals who were born in other countries, who make up about 18 
percent of all health care workers in the country despite making up 
15.5 percent of the population. Further, immigrants account for a third 
of direct care workers, and legal noncitizen immigrants make up 9 
percent of direct care workers despite accounting for only 5 percent of 
the population.
  In addition to caring for us when we are sick, immigrants feed us by 
forming the backbone of our food system. An estimated 70 to 80 percent 
of farmworkers are immigrants, between half and three quarters of whom 
are undocumented. Finally, both documented and undocumented immigrants 
pay billions of dollars in taxes to federal, state and local 
governments every year. In 2017 alone, this accounted for $405.4 
billion in taxes, including an estimated $27.2 billion paid by 
undocumented immigrants.
  Immigrants deserve not only to be recognized for these contributions, 
but to be respected as human beings taking part in one of the most 
integral traditions to the American way. For these reasons, we must 
ensure that the President does not exclude Immigrants, who make up the 
fabric of our nation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the

Tennessee (Mr. Cooper).
  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  I rise today to offer an amendment to provide $3 million for the 
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
Sustainment in order to continue the JASON scientific advisory group's 
major contributions to informing national security decisions.
  This funding will be the 61st year of JASON's activity. This funding 
is consistent with congressional intent and direction in the fiscal 
year 2020 appropriations bill to establish the JASON within the office 
of the Department of Defense.
  My amendment simply aligns funding for JASON and fiscal year 2021, 
following efforts by the former Under Secretary of Defense for Research 
and Engineering, Dr. Michael Griffin's attempt last year to abruptly 
cancel the longstanding JASON group contract. While the Defense 
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2020 moved the JASON contract to the 
Office of the Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment, the 
funding, unfortunately, did not follow.
  So I am deeply grateful, Madam Chair of the Appropriations Committee, 
for allowing this very important amendment to be included in the 
package.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in support of a bipartisan en bloc, which includes important 
changes to the bills that reflect Member priorities. I would also like 
to thank the full committee chairwoman and Chairman Visclosky for their 
willingness to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to 
accommodate as many amendments to the defense division as possible.
  It is vital to our work that we have input from members who know 
their districts best and who want to ensure their constituent interests 
are being reflected in the appropriations process.
  The defense portion of the bipartisan en bloc includes 55 amendments, 
and I thank the many Members who are included in this en bloc for input 
and insight.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Adams).
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to 
me.
  I rise in support of, specifically, my amendment to prohibit the use 
of Federal funds for the acquisition of chemical agents, such as 
teargas and pepper balls.
  Since the tragic death of George Floyd, millions of Americans have 
sought to exercise their first amendment right to protest and to 
assemble. Too often these actions have been met by the brutal force of 
the State as the elderly, as children, as those with medical conditions 
choke and asphyxiate due to the use of so-called riot control agents.
  Mr. Speaker, we can no longer condone the use of agents that hundreds 
of public health professionals say can help spread respiratory 
illnesses, such as COVID-19.
  The use of such agents is banned by international law, so why would 
we use them against our own people? This is absolutely unacceptable.
  And so with my amendment, it is my hope today that we are nearing the 
dawn of a fairer, more equitable and more just era of policing in this 
country.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the ranking member on the Commerce, Justice, 
Science Subcommittee.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan en 
bloc amendment. This amendment includes various provisions that make 
improvements to division B of this bill.
  Among other things, it increases funding to study the root cause of 
school violence.
  It also provides additional support for child advocacy centers, which 
will work to hold child abusers accountable

[[Page H4132]]

and help children heal through this process.
  This amendment also highlights the work of the International Trade 
Administration and its important role in the enforcement of the 
antidumping and countervailing duty laws. I agree with the amendment's 
sponsors that it is critical that the ITA allocates sufficient 
resources to protect American jobs from illegal foreign trade 
practices.
  Finally, the amendment also includes a strong bipartisan provision 
advancing university research on artificial intelligence.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing this is a good amendment, and I would 
recommend a ``yes'' vote.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose).
  Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I will begin by thanking the 
gentlewoman. I am a fourth generation New Yorker. I am a Jew. I am a 
vet. And you are a hero. It has been such an incredible honor to serve 
with you. Thank you for so much.
  I also thank Congressman Ruiz for partnering on this effort I would 
like to speak on today.
  I rise today in support of our amendment to increase appropriations 
for Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act grants, because when 
it comes to our law enforcement, the last thing that we should ever do 
is pinch pennies.
  There are few in this Chamber, heck, a few in this country, who know 
what it means to put your life on the line every single day for years 
in the service of others. Well, that is what the NYPD does every single 
day, and they do not get the appreciation that they deserve. That is as 
true today as it ever has been.

                              {time}  1215

  What law enforcement across the country deserves is our support, not 
just with our words, but with our budgetary decisions, because while 
our Nation confronts the realities of systemic racism both in our 
history and in our everyday life, the future that we must build is one 
based around unity. It is one where there is trust between the 
community and those who protect us.
  It is a future, though, where we also acknowledge that law 
enforcement officials are up to three times as likely to die from 
suicide as they are in the line of duty.
  Our officers have faced daily horrors during this pandemic. We have 
called them essential workers. They have always been essential.
  Something must be done in these hallowed Chambers.
  That is exactly what this program is for. It allows police 
departments to use these funds in a way that works best for their 
officers. That is why I am honored to offer this amendment yet another 
year with Dr. Ruiz.
  Each and every day, officers in my community on Staten Island and 
South Brooklyn are hugging their children, hugging their partners, 
their spouses good-bye, not knowing if they are going to return home. 
That is a stress that they live with every day that none of us can 
relate to.
  This program must be advanced in honor of their service.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Stauber-Tiffany-
Cox amendment, and I thank the gentleman for the time.
  This amendment comes after many years of experiencing well-documented 
U.S. Navy maintenance backlogs and deficiencies in much-needed naval 
upgrades. These backlogs and deficiencies seriously inhibit our force-
in-readiness and operational capabilities.
  Our military needs to be the readiest it can be in order to meet the 
challenges of the future, and this amendment will help them do that.
  Shipyards across the country are ready, willing, and able to support 
the maintenance and upgrade requirements needed by our naval assets, 
including one in Superior in my congressional district. These non-
homeport shipyards can support vital surge capacity, addressing 
maintenance needs that cannot be addressed in a timely fashion at 
homeports. This change will also support good, family-wage jobs across 
the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Cooper).
  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the great chair of the 
Appropriations Committee for including three words that Nashville, 
Tennessee, desperately needs in the pending legislation in order to 
better manage our Cumberland River. These three words are ``flood risk 
management.''
  A decade ago, Nashville suffered a devastating flood, costing more 
than two dozen lives and billions of dollars in damages. To mitigate 
the chance of future flooding, we need to allow the two Army Corps of 
Engineers-operated dams that are directly upstream from Nashville, 
namely Old Hickory and Cordell Hull, to be used for flood risk 
management.
  Contrary to common sense, these dams today may not be used for flood 
control, even in emergencies, unless they have previously been 
congressionally authorized to do so. The congressional authorization 
for Old Hickory and Cordell Hull Dams was made way back in 1946, and 
believe it or not, it still governs, regardless of the massive growth 
of Nashville and numerous subsequent floods.
  The archaic authority that the Corps has been operating under only 
allows Old Hickory and Cordell Hull to be used for navigation, 
recreation, and hydropower, but not for flood risk management. The 
Corps needs this flexibility to protect everyone downstream, as well as 
to prevent possible overtopping of their dams.
  I have buy-in from my District Corps to make this happen, and I hope 
the National Corps of Army Engineers listens.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Chairwoman Lowey and the entire 
Appropriations Committee for including this in the en bloc.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman and the ranking 
member for including two of my amendments in this bipartisan en bloc 
package, and I would specifically like to highlight one of my 
amendments that will provide $5 million for the Department of Defense 
to utilize community-based, nonprofit, post-traumatic growth 
organizations for mental health treatment.
  Suicide prevention is a top priority for the DOD, yet suicides in our 
military communities continue to rise. While current pharmaceutical and 
psychotherapy approaches help alleviate some struggles, they fail to 
address two key elements of resilience: social and spiritual fitness.
  My amendment provides resources to enable the DOD to employ a variety 
of pathways for our servicemembers and will allow the Department to 
leverage the resilience expertise of post-traumatic growth 
organizations that are seeing so much success. I am excited about this 
potential.
  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate their support of this amendment, and I ask 
everyone to support this package.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McNerney).
  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her hard work 
on the appropriations bill this year. It is never easy. This year is 
even harder. I thank, not only the chairwoman, but all the members of 
the committee. I thank them for their work, and I thank the chairwoman 
for including my amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to division B of 
H.R. 7617.
  This amendment is critical to advancing our Nation's competitiveness 
in artificial intelligence. It will require the National Science 
Foundation to examine, including through workshops, and to publish 
findings on the following:

  First, which universities are putting out significant peer reviewed 
AI research, including based on quantity and number of citations;
  Second, for each of the identified universities, what specific 
factors enabled their AI research, including computing power, data 
sets, and availability, specialized curriculum, and industry and other 
partnerships; and
  Third, how universities not included in this list could implement 
these factors to produce AI research as well as

[[Page H4133]]

case studies that universities can look to as examples and potential 
pilot programs that the Federal Government could develop or support to 
help universities produce AI research.
  AI research is critical to our Nation's competitiveness in artificial 
intelligence. We need to have a competitive spirit if we want to 
compete with China and other countries.
  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the AI Caucus, I am proud that this 
important amendment has received strong bipartisan support. I urge all 
of my colleagues to support it.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Bost).
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I 
thank the ranking member and the chair for including my amendment in 
the en bloc.
  Antidumping and countervailing duty laws exist to protect American 
workers and producers from economic injury caused by illegally traded 
foreign imports.
  Unfortunately, a tidal wave of illegally traded foreign imports is 
reaching our shores. Many of these products are produced by companies 
in nonmarket economies like China.
  As of today, the International Trade Administration has initiated 
more than 91 new antidumping and countervailing duty petitions. This is 
a record number, an increase of nearly 57 percent from the previous 
year.
  Unfortunately, resources at ITA have not kept pace with increasing 
caseloads and orders. Today, there are only eight AD/CVD offices when 
we need nine.
  While I appreciate the work of the chairman and ranking member to 
increase trade remedies for resources, more must be done. American 
workers should not face delayed relief when other nations are cheating.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Levin of Michigan). The time of the 
gentleman has expired.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Illinois.
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, Congress must provide sufficient resources to 
staff a ninth office. This includes providing a minimum of $96 million 
for antidumping and countervailing duty activities.
  In addition, we should require the Secretary of Commerce to provide 
quarterly reports to Congress on its progress in increasing AD/CVD 
activities and staffing levels.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Ruiz).
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 7617, which will increase funding for the Law Enforcement Mental 
Health and Wellness Act grant program by $2.5 million.
  In order to comprehensively address policing in our Nation, we must 
address the mental health needs of law enforcement officers. For 
example, officers are more than three times as likely to die by suicide 
than from shootings. Rates of depression among officers are more than 
four times higher and rates of PTSD are five times higher than the 
general population.
  That is why I have worked to substantially increase funding each year 
since these grants were created to help with law enforcement training, 
peer mentoring, and mental health program activities. It is important 
that our officers know they are not alone and that we provide the 
resources they need to protect our communities as well as their own 
mental well-being.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Rose for cosponsoring this 
amendment.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member for 
including my amendment in this en bloc amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simple. It gives the Secretary of the 
Navy the authority to solicit contracts from non-homeport shipyards for 
maintenance work to meet surge capacity should the shipyards meet the 
Navy's requirement for ship repair work.
  Currently, the Navy has a tremendous maintenance backlog, but under 
current law, there are certain restrictions that limit where naval 
vessels can undertake maintenance repair. Unless these restrictions are 
lifted, the Navy's backlog will only increase exponentially.
  At the same time, there are qualified shipyards in the rest of the 
United States, including the Great Lakes, Gulf Coast, and Alaska, that 
can perform repair work for certain types of naval vessels. These yards 
have the capacity and skills to do this work. They just need the 
chance.
  Last year, an amendment of mine was adopted into the 2020 NDAA. It 
requests the Navy report on the feasibility of doing maintenance work 
on naval vessels at shipyards other than shipyards in the vessel's 
homeport. The report was produced this spring, and within the report, 
the Navy concluded that the law could be modified to allow the Navy to 
use non-homeport shipyards to meet surge capacity.
  We have done the proper examination. Now it is time to give the Navy 
the authority it needs to reduce its maintenance backlog. This 
amendment provides an opportunity for the Navy to diversify their 
industrial base, create resilience, and improve our military readiness.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Tiffany and Congressman Cox for 
cosponsoring this amendment.

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).
  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.
  I rise today in support of this en bloc, which includes my amendment 
to prohibit funds from being used to implement, administer, and enforce 
a recent rule forcing DNA collection from immigrant detainees. The 
rollout of this policy started in January when CBP and ICE began 
collecting DNA samples from people as young as 14 years old at the 
Border Patrol sector in Detroit, Michigan.
  Is this how we are going to do this? We are going to just stop and 
not try to fix our immigration system, and this is what we are going to 
do to people, which is violate their human rights?
  We must stop this administration from forcing collection of DNA, 
actual parts of people's bodies, from families and individuals. We must 
push back, because this would indefinitely store DNA information, 
creating a permanent law enforcement record for folks who may have 
never even been accused or convicted of a crime.
  So, Mr. Speaker, we must stand up against xenophobic criminalization 
of our immigrant neighbors.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Serrano and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez 
for working with me on this measure, and I urge support for this 
amendment.

                              {time}  1230

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member   
Ken Calvert for yielding.
  I am grateful to support two amendments, Nos. 94 and 95 to division A 
of H.R. 7617. These two amendments would prohibit taxpayer money from 
going to the Badr Organization and other murderous Iranian-backed 
militias comprising the Popular Mobilization Units.
  The Badr Organization, perhaps the largest and most murderous 
Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, which has oppressed the people of Iran, 
was founded by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps with the mandate 
to export Iran's failing Islamic revolution.
  They are controlled by the tyrannical regime in Tehran and have a 
long history of involvement in attacks directly targeting Americans and 
our NATO allies in Iraq. Their deranged leader proudly brags of his 
involvement in the New Year's Eve attack on unarmed civilians at our 
Embassy in Baghdad.
  Badr and other cowardly Iranian-backed militias should not be the 
beneficiaries of U.S. aid. They have blood on their hands, and the 
American people should not be funding them.
  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments and the underlying 
bill.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Cardenas).
  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Appropriations 
Committee and the subcommittee chairs for including two amendments that 
I submitted to H.R. 7617, division

[[Page H4134]]

B and division F, in the en bloc being considered today.
  For years, we have been funding a juvenile justice system that is 
robbing children of their futures and wasting taxpayer dollars. Today, 
experts, academics, advocates, and police departments agree we must 
change that for the better.
  I am proud to have introduced two amendments to H.R. 7617, division 
B, that will increase funding for programs that focus on girls in the 
juvenile justice system and invest in collaborative mental health and 
antirecidivism initiatives.
  I have also cosponsored an amendment led by my colleague, Congressman 
Rush, that will increase funding for community-based violence 
prevention initiatives and also introduced an amendment to H.R. 7617, 
division F, that will increase funds for the National Child Traumatic 
Stress Initiative. This investment will help increase evidence-based 
support for youth with mental health needs that have been exacerbated 
by this pandemic.
  I ask for my colleagues to support this bill and my amendments that 
are offered today. We need to have a better system for our children.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan amendment would transfer 
$21.3 billion from the procurement account to the Marine Corps' JLTV 
and transfer it from the funds from the Defense-wide operation and 
maintenance account.
  We want to make sure the JLTV is delivered to our servicemembers on 
schedule and on cost. I have come to understand that, last year, the 
Marine Corps had substantially higher fielding costs than they 
anticipated for this vehicle, so they had to transfer funds from 
purchasing more vehicles to fielding the vehicles they had.
  I understand why the Appropriations Committee, being fiscally 
responsible, saw that they shifted money and therefore gave them less 
of these new vehicles than they thought they needed. However, the 
Marine Corps had two options: pay the incurred costs or not pay for 
these costs and not have operational JLTVs. The Marine Corps has 
demonstrated the need for these trucks and requested funding for 752 of 
them to be appropriated in FY21.
  My bipartisan amendment will accomplish this. I think we in Congress 
can work with the Marine Corps, the least-funded branch of the armed 
services.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. Crow).
  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of en bloc package No. 
2, which contains my bipartisan amendment to provide resources for a 
key national defense priority.
  The threat to our servicemembers from sophisticated, state-
manufactured unmanned aerial systems, or drones, is serious and 
requires us to pursue innovative and advanced solutions.
  My amendment would increase by $5 million the Army RDT&E air and 
missile defense advanced technology line in order to integrate and 
demonstrate a modular, multimission capability consisting of 
surveillance, electronic warfare, and high-energy laser into a remotely 
operated robotic vehicle. The integrated prototype would demonstrate an 
ability to remotely detect, identify, and mitigate UAS threats so that 
we can better protect our troops and bases.
  I would like to thank Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Calvert 
for working with me on this amendment. Additionally, I would like to 
recognize Mr. Lamborn, Mr. Langevin, Mr. Buck, and Ms. Haaland for 
their leadership and support on this issue.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


       Amendments En Bloc No. 3 Offered by Mrs. Lowey of New York

  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1067, I offer 
amendments en bloc.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendments en 
bloc.
  Amendments en bloc No. 3 consisting of amendment Nos. 19, 39, 47, 58, 
65, 76, 77, 79, 85, 88, 98, 113, 162, 181, 188, 201, 207, 214, 225, 
242, 248, 249, 268, 296, 309, 325, 326, and 333, printed in part B of 
House Report 116-461, offered by Mrs. Lowey of New York:
  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendment which will provide an additional five million dollars in 
support of pancreatic cancer research, including early detection, at 
the Department of Defense (DoD). Considering Rep. Lewis' recent passing 
from pancreatic cancer, and Rep. Hastings' current fight against this 
disease, I am grateful that my colleagues came together today to pass 
this amendment--included in En Bloc No. 2--by unanimous voice vote. 
This is a fitting tribute today, when our colleague, John Robert Lewis, 
is laid to rest in Atlanta.
  This amendment builds on the incredible work done by the Defense 
Subcommittee on this issue. The Defense Subcommittee has already 
appropriated $10 million for pancreatic research at the Department of 
Defense (DoD), which is an increase of four million dollars from the 
previous year. I am thankful to the Defense Subcommittee, especially 
Chairman Visclosky, for their leadership on this issue.
  By passing my amendment, the House will increase appropriations for 
pancreatic cancer research at DoD from $10 million to $15. I am 
grateful that my colleague, Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, has 
cosponsored my amendment--she is a great leader on behalf of pancreatic 
cancer research and the Chairwoman of the Health Subcommittee in the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. I am also thankful for the support of 
the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, whose support and advocacy for 
this amendment has been critical in our efforts.
  Today's amendment also builds on my previous amendment to the 
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which the House passed last 
week, that authorized $5 million for a pancreatic cancer early 
detection initiative at the Department of Defense (DoD). My amendment 
also complements report language in the Defense appropriations bill, 
which states that ``early detection of pancreatic cancer requires 
additional research'' and encourages the director of the 
Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) at DoD to 
``expand early detection research for pancreatic cancer'' to include 
pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals, ``as well as those in 
underserved ethnic and minority communities.''
  Just a few weeks ago, this issue hit painfully close to home as 
America lost a giant to pancreatic cancer. Rep. John Lewis, our civil 
rights hero and Conscience of the Congress, passed away from pancreatic 
cancer only seven months after receiving his diagnosis. My amendment is 
inspired by Rep. Lewis' courageous battle against pancreatic cancer and 
also by Rep. Alcee Hastings' ongoing fight. It is unacceptable that, 
despite being the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in our 
country, pancreatic cancer still does not have a dedicated early 
detection initiative.
  Rep. Lewis' short battle against pancreatic cancer is, sadly, often 
the norm for patients. In fact, the lack of research in ways to detect 
pancreatic cancer early has led to devastating consequences: sixty-six 
percent of patients live less than one year following their diagnosis. 
If diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer 
patients is above eighty percent. However, if pancreatic cancer is 
detected late, the five-year survival rate drops to less than five 
percent. By failing to support our nation's researchers with the means 
to find new ways to detect pancreatic cancer early, we are leaving 
American's pancreatic cancer patients with few ways to detect this 
disease in time to extend the quality and duration of their lives. Rep. 
Lewis' struggle against this horrifying disease should serve as a 
sobering reminder of the human cost of failing to support early 
detection research for pancreatic cancer.
  It's important to note that persistent health care inequities and 
disparities for communities of color compound the devastation of 
pancreatic cancer. In fact, the incidence rate for pancreatic cancer 
among Black Americans is twenty percent higher than that of any other 
racial demographic. This disease is deadlier for us; the pancreatic 
cancer death rate is seventeen percent higher for Black men than for 
white men. Significant evidence demonstrates that these 
disproportionate levels of pancreatic cancer are, in large part, rooted 
in disparities in health care and access to tests and diagnostics. As a 
result, the lack of pancreatic cancer early detection research 
accelerates

[[Page H4135]]

the racial unfairness in our health care system, with devastating 
consequences for minorities.
  At a time when our country is having a national conversation about 
the deep disparities in access to health care for Black and Brown 
people during a global pandemic, Congress must do everything within our 
power to improve health outcomes through research and treatment. 
Passing this amendment is a critical way to increase our investment in 
pancreatic cancer research, including early detection, and to help 
address the pancreatic cancer disparities for communities of color.
  I thank my colleagues for including my amendment in En Bloc No. 2 and 
for passing this amendment today by voice vote. I urge my colleagues to 
support final passage of H.R. 7617 as amended.
  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, year after year since coming to Congress, I 
have led efforts in the House to secure funding for Violence Against 
Women programs. I was honored to have led the efforts to renew the VAWA 
authorizing legislation in 2013. This is personal for me. And I want to 
make sure that for all of those who are going through the horror that 
domestic violence, they know that they have a place to go or services 
and supports to turn to get through those dark days.
  VAWA is essential legislation that provides the premier services for 
survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. However, that 
authorizing language is only as good as we actually fund it. With 
domestic violence-related homicides on the rise, now more than ever, we 
need these funds and we need these funds right now.
  I have offered two amendments to this bill for programs that are in 
desperate need for additional funds.
  I applaud the committee for their efforts but like so many programs, 
the need continues to outpace available resources. The first amendment 
I submitted is for the Transitional Housing Program. This program 
provides transitional housing and short-term housing assistance for 
victims and their children or other dependents. With many victims stuck 
at home during the pandemic, access to safe housing can be the 
difference between life and death.
  I also offered an amendment to increase funding for the Sexual 
Assault Services Program. This essential program provides grants to 
rape crisis centers and other agencies for survivors of sexual assault. 
I am so proud of the work that these programs have done but we cannot 
limit the resources required to combat sexual violence in our 
communities during these dire times.
  I am glad that these amendments have been included in En Bloc and 
thank Chairwoman Lowey and Chairman Serrano for their support. I 
encourage my colleagues to support this En Bloc.
  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc Amendment No. 2 
which includes my amendment No. 35 to the Department of Defense 
Division to provide an additional $5 Million for the Defense POW/MIA 
Accounting Agency (DPAA).
  Mr. Speaker, we ask much of our men and women in uniform, especially 
when they are deployed into battle. They risk injury and indeed their 
lives to carry out the missions that keep America safe and protect our 
values around the world. In return, we make a promise to them that if 
the worst were to happen, we would ensure that they will be brought 
home to their families. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency's mission 
is to do just that for the over 82,000 American Prisoners of War and 
Missing in Action servicemembers since World War II still waiting to be 
returned.
  The DPAA works through diplomatic partnerships with 46 host nations 
and collaborates with veterans service organizations, non-profit 
institutions. and other private sector entities in order to maximize 
scarce resources to find our missing servicemembers. They bring a 
steadfast dedication to this mission, and we must ensure they have the 
resources they need.
  Since the 2015 reorganization of its predecessor organization, the 
Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, the DPAA has taken meaningful steps 
towards refining its mission, unifying agency functions and personnel, 
and augmenting its accounting and recovery operations. Through my 
position as Chairman of the National Security Subcommittee I have 
continued to exercise Congressional oversight to ensure that these 
reforms are being optimally implemented, including leading several 
bipartisan Congressional Delegations to the DPPA headquarters and 
skeletal identification laboratory at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, 
as well as to their recovery missions in Vietnam, the Korean Peninsula 
and the Philippines. and most recently, holding an oversight hearing in 
the National Security Subcommittee last November.
  The additional $5 Million that this amendment provides will help the 
DPAA continue to build upon its reforms. as well as continue its 
ongoing and vital work.
  I would like to thank Representative Jody Hice for cosponsoring this 
amendment and for his leadership in supporting POW/MIA identification 
and recovery efforts. I would also like to thank Representative Mark 
Green, with whom I have the pleasure of collaborating on helping 
veterans who were deployed to the former K2 Forward Operating Base, for 
cosponsoring this amendment as well.
  I would like to thank Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Lowey and 
Ranking Member Granger for including this amendment in the en bloc.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of En 
Bloc No. 2, to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science, 
Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General 
Government, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, 
Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act.
  I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for including 
several amendments in the Rule for House consideration of H.R. 7617.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 30, included in En Bloc No. 2, reduces 
funding for Operations and Maintenance-Defense Wide, by $5 million and 
increases funding for Defense Health Care for PTSD by $5 million.
  My amendment increases funding for PTSD by $5,000,000.
  These funds should be used toward outreach activities targeting hard 
to reach veterans, especially those who are homeless or reside in 
underserved urban and rural areas, who suffer from Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder (PTSD).
  Along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is the signature wound 
suffered by the brave men and women fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
far off lands to defend the values and freedom we hold dear.
  For those of us whose daily existence is not spent in harm's way, it 
is difficult to imagine the horrific images that American servicemen 
and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other theaters of war see 
daily.
  In an instant, a suicide bomber, an IED, or an insurgent can 
obliterate your best friend right in front of your face. Yet, you are 
trained and expected to continue with the mission, and you do, even 
though you may not have even reached your 20th birthday.
  But there always comes a reckoning. And it usually comes after the 
stress and trauma of battle is over, and you are alone with your 
thoughts and memories.
  And the horror of those desperate and dangerous encounters with the 
enemy and your own mortality come flooding back.
  PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war 
veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such 
as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural 
disasters such as floods or earthquakes.
  We can now add COVID-19 with the stress of watching the American 
people fight off a foe they cannot confront and defeat.
  We must address PTSD in all its forms so that it can be defeated.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 31, included in En Bloc No. 2, reduces 
funding for Operations and Maintenance-Defense Wide, by $10 million and 
increases funding for Defense Health Care for Triple Negative Breast 
Cancer (TNBC) by $10 million.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 31 reduces funding for Operations and 
Maintenance-Defense Wide, by $10 million and increases funding for 
Defense Health Care for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) by $10 
million.
  My amendment increases funding for the Defense Health Program's 
research and development by $10 million. These funds will address the 
question of breast cancer in the United States military.
  The American Cancer Society calls several strains of breast cancer as 
a particularly aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates; 
in this instance, it's a triple negative. But I raise an article that 
says: ``Fighting a Different Battle; Breast Cancer and the Military.''
  The American Cancer Society reports the following 5-year survival 
rates for breast cancer:
  stage 0 to 1--near 100 percent survival rate;
  stage 2--about 93 percent survival rate;
  stage 3--72 percent survival rate; and
  stage 4 (metastatic)--22 percent survival rate.
  Triple Negative Breast Cancer is more aggressive than other types of 
breast cancer.
  Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely 
to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur (come back) after 
treatment.
  The risk appears to be greatest in the first few years after 
treatment.

[[Page H4136]]

  For example, a study of more than 1,600 women in Canada published in 
2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer were at higher 
risk of having the cancer recur outside the breast--but only for the 
first 3 years.
  In 2013, the American Cancer Society Surveillance and Health Services 
Institute estimated that 27,060 black women would be diagnosed with the 
illness.
  The rate of breast cancer is 10 percent lower in African American 
women than white women--it is the type of breast cancer (Triple 
Negative) that African American women contract that is alarming.
  Because African American women are diagnosed in greater numbers with 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer, we have a five-year survival rate of 78 
percent after diagnosis as compared to 90 perent for white women.
  The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher 
for African American women compared to white women.
  Triple Negative Breast Cancer:
  Accounts for between 13 percent and 25 percent of all breast cancer 
in the United States;
  onset is at a younger age;
  is more aggressive; and
  is more likely to metastasize.
  Currently, 70 percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast 
cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.
  African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple-
negative breast cancer than White women.
  African-American women have prevalence TNBC of 26 percent vs. 16 
percent in non-African-American women.
  Funding to support women serving in the military to address the 
incidence of Triple Negative Breast cancer can benefit from this 
Jackson Lee Amendment.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 29, included in En Bloc No. 2, increases 
and decreases the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund by $2 
million to provide the Secretary of Defense the flexibility needed for 
technical assistance for U.S. military women to military women in other

of war, terrorism, human trafficking, and narcotics trafficking.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 102, included in En Bloc No. 2, increases 
and decreases by $2,000,000 funding for the Office of Justice Programs

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Calvert) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in support of the Republican en bloc, which includes important 
changes to the bill that would enable us to finish our work and deliver 
to the President a bill that he could sign, including removing language 
prohibiting the funding of the border wall.
  While I certainly agree with my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle that wall funding should not come from the DOD, it is unfortunate 
that the majority continues to ignore the problem along our southern 
border and funds no wall construction or Border Patrol agents in their 
FY 2021 Homeland Security appropriations bill. In doing so, they are 
forcing the administration to deal with the security of our borders 
through any means possible, including using DOD funds to build the 
wall.
  Finally, I will simply say that all Members should have an 
opportunity to have their voice heard on annual appropriation bills on 
the House floor. While I acknowledge the difficulty of doing our work 
safely during the pandemic, and I thank the chairwoman for the 
bipartisan en bloc, which includes many of our minority's priorities, 
nothing should stifle our Members from having the opportunity to offer 
debate and have a vote on an amendment germane to the bill.
  Therefore, I urge adoption of the Republican en bloc, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Committee on Appropriations.
  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for all 
the wonderful work that she has done on this appropriation bill, a very 
balanced bill that she has done, and I want to thank Kay Granger and 
also Mr. Calvert for the work that they have done, even though we do 
have a disagreement. Let me talk about the wall.
  With all due respect, I always get a kick out of people who don't 
live close to the border, they might live about 1,000 miles away from 
the border, but they are the first ones who would tell us what we need 
to have at our border, in our own backyard.
  Earlier this month, President AMLO from Mexico was at a press 
conference with President Trump. President Trump had said we need a 
wall, and we are going to have Mexico pay. I did not hear the President 
say: Where is that check to pay for the wall?
  So what is happening is, the master dealmaker is now asking the U.S. 
taxpayers to pay for this wall after he promised that Mexico would pay 
for this wall.
  Again, the taxpayers are paying for this. We are taking money away 
from the defense. We are taking money away from military construction. 
And we are taking money away from other places to pay for that 14th 
century solution called a wall.
  I will tell you where we are on the wall. After 3 years, we only have 
3 miles--and I emphasize 3 miles--of new wall. Everything else is 
replacement. Everything else is double wall--only 3 miles of new 
fencing that we have had.
  Again, if you look at it, and I think you have seen some of the 
videos, the wall is falling apart. It is falling apart. Again, why are 
we spending billions of dollars to build this wall when it is falling 
apart?
  If you ask every Border Patrol chief, including the Border Patrol 
chief under President Trump, if you ask him, ``How much time does the 
wall buy you?'' they say, ``A few seconds or a few minutes, depending 
on who wants to cross over.''
  So why are we spending billions of dollars to stop this? I have asked 
the experts on the border, which is Border Patrol: Do we need a wall? I 
always ask this question: Is it post-2012, or pre-2012? Because before 
2012, the Border Patrol agents were saying that the wall was 
ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars itself.
  Now, there are two main reasons why people called for the wall. One 
is to stop people coming in illegally, and the other is to stop drugs.
  Let me talk about people coming in illegally. If you look at it, the 
last 7 consecutive years, visa overstays exceeded illegal border 
crossings. If you look at the last 2016-2017 numbers that we have, visa 
overstays accounted for 62 percent of the newly undocumented immigrants 
that we had.
  If you look at the number one violators, with due respect to our 
Canadians, it is Canadians that are the number one violators of these 
visa overstays. So it is not people coming from the south, but it is 
visa overstays.
  I dare you to say that we need a wall on the northern border. I dare 
any of you all to say that, and I bet nobody is going to say that.

[[Page H4138]]

  If you want to stop folks from coming in, look at visa overstays. 
Sixty-two percent of the undocumented immigrants that we have are visa 
overstays.
  Now, the other reason is drugs. Drugs, we have to stop the drugs. If 
you look at the official numbers from CBP, you will see that in FY19, 
just last year, 89 percent of the cocaine coming into the United States 
came up through bridges, our bridges. Only 11 percent came through in-
between bridges.
  If you look at heroin, 84 percent of the heroin that came into the 
United States came in through our bridges, and then the rest came in 
in-between.
  If you talk about fentanyl, and I have heard so many people talk 
about fentanyl, 92 percent of all the fentanyl coming into the United 
States comes through our bridges, and only 8 percent in-between itself.
  If you talk about meth, 81 percent of all the meth coming into the 
United States comes through our bridges.
  Again, I want to stop drugs. I want to stop illegal migration. But we 
have to make sure that we look at this the right way.
  Finally, let me say, I believe in private property rights. Why is it 
that we have forgotten about private property rights for all of those 
people who live along the border?
  Imagine if you had land there for generations and then here comes the 
big bad Federal Government to take the land away. We have to protect 
the environment, private property rights, and if you want to stop drugs 
and people coming in, let's do it the right way. So again, I believe in 
law and order, but we have to do it the right way.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).

  Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on my amendment to 
fund the border wall.
  Our country has suffered this year. We have all experienced hardship 
as a pandemic rapidly made its way onto our shores. Americans are 
resilient. We are rebuilding our economy, and we will persevere.
  However, we must not forget about the ongoing crisis on our southern 
border. In their bill, my colleagues across the aisle want to strike 
all funding for border wall construction. This is not the time. We need 
to focus.
  It was just months ago when nearly every Member of Congress joined 
together to ban deadly fentanyl from our country. This was such a 
strong statement to showcase our commitment to combating the opioid 
epidemic. Thanks to our strong border wall and the heroic efforts of 
the men and women who guard it, our border is currently more secure 
than it has ever been. Defunding the wall will weaken enforcement 
efforts and hurt our communities.
  During the pandemic, overdoses in West Virginia alone have risen by 
50 percent compared to a year ago. Now is not the time to turn a blind 
eye toward the drug smugglers who are looking to capitalize on our 
hardship.
  We cannot abandon our vulnerable populations. We cannot stop 
construction. We need to finish the wall. We need a strong and stable 
border to show our commitment to stop crime and make sure that security 
is available to every single American.
  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of my amendment and 
the entire Republican en bloc.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), who is the ranking member of the Commerce, 
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of this amendment. 
The amendment improves the bill by including addressing several 
important Republican priorities, especially in division B.
  For example, it increases the funding for school hardening measures 
under the STOP School Violence Act. It offsets this cost with a 
reduction of unauthorized appropriations for a new program that is 
included in the bill that will provide lawyers for undocumented 
immigrants arriving at our southern border.
  The amendment also strikes a provision in the bill that would 
restrict the data of the Census Bureau that it can provide to the 
American people. The American people deserve more information when it 
comes to the Census, not less. The Trump administration has rightly 
made developing complete and accurate data on the U.S. population a top 
priority.
  In addition, this amendment highlights the important work of the 
Department of Commerce in advancing U.S. leadership in space.
  Finally, the amendment would increase funding for NOAA's Weather and 
Climate Operational Supercomputing System.
  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the sponsors of this 
amendment for their efforts to highlight important, yet sometimes 
overlooked, priorities that very much improve this bill, and I 
recommend a ``yes'' on the amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. Newhouse). The gentleman is from the land of hops.
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, one in five households with a disabled family member 
falls below the Federal poverty line. These families rely on home 
healthcare providers who are often family members of the disabled to 
care for them and to improve their quality of life. These providers 
receive modest compensation for their efforts provided by dedicated 
State Medicaid dollars.
  For decades, Federal law has required that Medicaid providers be paid 
directly and in full for the services they provide. However, some 
States, including my own home State of Washington, have been 
withholding union dues via payroll deductions from payments to 
Medicaid-subsidized home caregivers. In many cases, this is done 
without the knowledge or the consent of the caregiver, and it is in 
clear violation of the law.
  Now, this is no small problem. In 2017 alone, $150 million was 
diverted to unions from Medicaid payments to 350,000 caregivers. 
Fortunately, last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
finalized a rule to stop this predatory practice that takes money out 
of the pockets of in-home providers. However, language in the bill 
would defund implementation of this rule and allow States to continue 
to circumvent Federal law.
  My amendment strikes section 245 of the bill to ensure that CMS can 
enforce the law and protect home healthcare providers from having their 
Medicaid payments diverted to third parties.
  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: Ending this illegal deduction does not 
prevent caregivers from joining unions if they wish; rather, it 
empowers them by giving them the choice to do so. My amendment gives 
them that choice.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Wright).
  Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment 
which would remove harmful language that seeks to upend religious 
freedom protections for organizations across America.
  Earlier this year, the Department of Labor took an important step in 
preserving the Constitution and ensuring the rights of religious 
employers. It is simple: Faith-based groups should be on equal footing 
as they compete with other employers without having to give up their 
sincerely held religious beliefs. Organizations such as the Salvation 
Army and Catholic Charities should not be afraid to partner with the 
Federal Government to help Americans.
  Unfortunately, if House Democrats have their way and roll back these 
important religious protections, these organizations will face 
uncertainty and confusion in the Federal contracting process, possibly 
opting out altogether.

  Beyond the fact that it is wrong to tell these organizations that 
they cannot work with the Federal Government to provide essential 
services, it is flat-out unconstitutional.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand by their commitment to the 
Constitution and protect religious liberty

[[Page H4139]]

for all Americans by supporting my amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Bost).
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for including my amendment in this en bloc package.
  My amendment has a straightforward goal: increasing support for 
school safety grants under the STOP School Violence Act.
  Last Congress, I introduced legislation which is now law to provide 
grants to local school districts to strengthen security on school 
grounds. This was made part of the broader bipartisan STOP School 
Violence Act enacted last Congress.
  In my southern Illinois district, these funds have been used by the 
Shawnee Community School District to build an emergency communications 
cell tower. The Meridian School District uses the funds to hire a 
school resources officer.
  As a father, grandfather, and former first responder, I hope that our 
young people can return to the classroom soon. I hope that this money 
is available to make sure that they are even safer.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc package.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is the ranking member of the Education 
and Labor Committee.
  Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
California for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an issue of great importance 
to Americans: the ability to choose high-quality and affordable 
healthcare and increase competition among healthcare providers to drive 
down costs.
  Included in this package is my amendment to codify the 
administration's rule requiring hospitals to post the prices they have 
negotiated with insurers and their cash discounted prices for about 300 
common services. This rule is a step forward towards empowering 
patients by giving them the information they need to make informed 
decisions and take control of their healthcare.
  Pulling back the curtain on hospital charges allows patients to shop 
around for the best price and will spur competition and innovation 
among hospitals for these services and, ultimately, result in lower 
prices for patients. It is a shame that Democrats appear to oppose this 
commonsense policy which will save money for patients and our 
healthcare system.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this en bloc 
amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).
  Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment No. 225.
  Last year, the Trump administration finalized a rule to allow 
employers to use flexible health reimbursement arrangements, HRAs, to 
fund insurance premiums for coverage purchased on the individual 
market. This will allow more Americans to shop for their own coverage 
and allow more employers to provide quality health benefits. Expanding 
the use of HRAs will increase overall coverage by 800,000 and provide 
strong protections for those with preexisting conditions.
  Congress needs to provide certainty for employers who want to provide 
this benefit. That is why my amendment would ensure that no funds in 
this act may be used to withdraw the final HRA rule.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to adopt my commonsense amendment.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).
  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment, 
which is included in this bloc.
  My amendment strikes language in the underlying bill which would 
prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from implementing 
important reforms to the rules governing shareholder proposals.
  The current rules, which haven't been updated since the Eisenhower 
administration, allow activists to repeatedly resubmit divisive 
proposals that have been rejected by a vast majority of shareholders. 
In fact, many resubmissions received only a single-digit share of the 
vote the year before.
  A 2018 study of almost 2,500 activist shareholder proposals over 
nearly two decades found that proposals that had been submitted three 
or more times made up 32 percent of all the failed proposals. This can 
have a significant negative impact on public companies which continue 
to decline in number. Responding to each proposal takes time, and 
companies are forced to deal with multiple resubmissions of failed 
proposals each year. Importantly, this diverts the limited resources 
away from growth, job creation, and innovation.
  Especially in today's challenging economic environment, we should 
support policies that encourage opportunity. The SEC's efforts to raise 
the bar for resubmissions are a step forward for workers, investors, 
and the health of our economy.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, I urge a 
``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were rejected.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

             Amendment No. 49 Offered by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
49 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division A (before the short title) insert 
     the following:
       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made 
     available by this Act may be used by any of the Armed Forces 
     for twitch.tv or esports activities.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I present this amendment by opening 
with the stance of the U.S. Marine Corps, which is that: ``War is not a 
game.'' I'm quoting the Marines. The Marine Service brand and issues 
associated with combat are too serious to be gamified in a responsible 
manner.
  Now, this amendment is specifically to block recruitment practices 
and funding for recruitment practices on platforms such as Twitch.tv, 
which are live-streaming platforms that are largely populated by 
children well under the age of military recruitment rules. Children as 
young as 13, and oftentimes as young as 12, are targeted for 
recruitment forms that can be filled online.
  This amendment is in direct alignment with both those values but also 
the values that children should not be targeted in general for many 
marketing purposes, in addition to military service.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and 
I

[[Page H4140]]

do appreciate the gentlewoman's concerns.
  Mr. Speaker, I would begin my remarks by saying the United States 
military is a very special place. Only about 30 percent of young 
Americans between 17 and 24 are eligible to join the military. Others 
are not because of educational issues, because of health issues, and 
other circumstances.
  It is clear we have to make an investment in society. But having said 
that, this is a special place and we ought to cast a very broad net to 
encourage young Americans to serve their country in the military, 
especially those--I would point out, living in Gary, Indiana--in 
disadvantaged communities, many of which don't even know that 
opportunity exists.
  The gentlewoman is concerned about abuses, and I share that concern, 
and I think Mr. Calvert certainly does. We have seen abuses--setting 
the issue of technology aside--with recruiters making false promises. 
That is why we have controls in place. That is why those people are 
punished. That is why we have Congressional oversight.
  Mr. Speaker, I do understand the criticism of younger people viewing 
esports channels. The ArmyEsports team Twitch channel has been set to 
18-plus since August of 2019. I would grant that it is difficult in 
many instances to verify age online, and I do find recent media reports 
on the ArmyEsports team in the banning of commentators concerning. It 
is difficult to balance a platform's churn of service and community 
guidelines with free speech, and I understand that ArmyEsports has 
taken a pause on streaming and is reviewing its internal policies and 
procedures.
  We, on the committee, certainly look forward to seeing the results of 
that review to allow the military to learn how to ensure that these 
platforms are used properly in the future.
  The gentlewoman rightly also points out the issue of age. I would 
point out to all of my colleagues in this Chamber, that our bill 
already funds educational programs that give children under the age of 
16 exposure to military service, including Junior ROTC, Civil Air 
Patrol, STARBASE, National Guard Youth Challenge, Young Marines, and 
Sea Cadets. These programs are in high demand and enjoy great 
bipartisan support.
  Mr. Speaker, the concern is well-placed. It is the reason we have to 
exercise great oversight and control, but I do have to oppose the 
gentlewoman's amendment.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, once again, I think it is 
extraordinarily important, especially when it comes to emerging 
technology platforms, that intervention be taken extraordinarily 
seriously, because once these lights are turned on, it is very 
difficult to roll them back. Right now, currently children on platforms 
such as Twitch are bombarded with banner ads that link to recruitment 
signup forms that can be submitted by children as young as 12 years 
old. These are not educational outreach programs, but recruitment forms 
for the military.
  A Twitter account for the USArmyEsports team linked to a page with 
``Register to Win'' at the top--no details on what one could even win--
and a signup form that, according to a tiny disclosure at the bottom of 
the page, consents to contact by an Army recruiter, again allowing 
people as young as 12 years old to submit this form.
  Viewers on the Army's Twitch channel are repeatedly presented with an 
automated prompt that says they could win an X-box Elite Series 2 
controller that cost upwards of $200, and a link where they can enter 
the ``giveaway.'' It, too, directs them to a recruitment form, which 
has no additional mention of a contest, odds, total number of winners, 
or when a drawing will occur.
  Again, it is extraordinarily important that we approach and study 
emerging technologies, including live-streaming, which is a platform 
that is exploding in use, particularly among young people. And when it 
comes to issues of technology, I believe that we should act with 
reservation and caution first rather than entering with both feet in 
and then trying to undo damage that could potentially be done.
  That is why I believe that we should, again, restrain and restrict 
ourselves from explicit recruitment tactics--not others, but 
recruitment specifically--on platforms that children are using to play 
games from Animal Crossing to Call of Duty.
  Additionally, there was also the extraordinary concern within the 
Marine Corps of conflating military service with shoot-em-up style 
first-person shooters. We cannot conflate war and military service with 
this kind of gamified format.

  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, serving in the United States military is an 
honor, and we should be thanking the thousands of young people who 
choose to join the military to defend this great Nation.
  The assertion that joining the military is a bad thing for low-income 
youth or any young person, is fundamentally flawed. It is insulting to 
the men and women who currently serve and those who served before them.
  The military recruits the best and the brightest. They should not be 
prohibited from recruiting the best and the brightest from lower, 
socioeconomic classes or in the activities in which young people 
participate, such as esports.
  In fact, studies show that when compared to their peers, military 
veterans do better across-the-board on education attainment, income, 
and quality of life.
  It is important to remember the quotation, ``This Nation will remain 
the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.'' The 
world is more dangerous now than it has ever been. It is because of the 
brave men and women in our military that our freedoms and security are 
assured.
  I respect each branch of our military and it is the moral 
responsibility of every Member of this body to show these men and women 
the respect and the appreciation they deserve. Please join me in doing 
just that and voting ``no'' on this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


               Amendment No. 87 Offered by Mr. Blumenauer

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
87 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       At the end of division B (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act to 
     the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to any of 
     the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, 
     Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, 
     Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, 
     Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
     Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
     Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, 
     Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
     Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West 
     Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, or with respect to the 
     District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
     Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the United States 
     Virgin Islands, to prevent any of them from implementing 
     their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, 
     possession, or cultivation of marijuana.
       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act to 
     the Department of Justice may be used to prevent any Indian 
     tribe (as such term is defined in section 4 of the Indian 
     Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 
     5304)) from enacting or implementing tribal laws that 
     authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation 
     of marijuana.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.

[[Page H4141]]

  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, since 1996, when California voters made 
that State the first in the country to legalize medical marijuana, we 
have seen a revolution taking place in cannabis policy. This has been 
driven almost entirely by advocates and activists mounting successful 
campaigns to have voters in 33 States legalize medical marijuana.
  Starting in 2012 in Washington State, in Colorado, followed quickly 
by Oregon and Alaska, voters legalized adult use. Today, 10 States, and 
the District of Columbia, have legalized adult use. In all, 47 States 
have legalized some form of cannabis use. This year, voters in 6 more 
States will decide on future progress.
  Through this revolution, we have watched, across the country, 
shifting attitudes and moving forward. The Federal Government, sadly, 
is still trapped by the dead hand of Richard Nixon's ``war on drugs,'' 
declaring cannabis a Schedule I controlled substance--wait a minute--
despite objective evidence that it is not highly addictive and it does 
have therapeutic benefit.
  That is why we are making progress in this Congress to catch up with 
the rest of America, and the multi-billion dollar--$12 billion by some 
estimates this year--industry, which pays $2 billion to State and local 
governments, much of it, sadly, with $20 bills in duffel bags.
  Mr. Speaker, we passed the SAFE Banking Act on the floor of this 
House earlier in the Congress with 321 bipartisan votes. Sadly, it is 
still languishing in the Senate, but luckily, it is in the HEROES Act 
that we passed over to them. We have passed out of the Committee on the 
Judiciary, the MORE Act, which would fully legalize cannabis. And make 
no mistake, that day is coming.
  Over two-thirds of the American voters support it, including a 
majority of Republican voters, and that support is what fueled a 
situation today when 47 States have some form of cannabis that is 
legalized.
  In the meantime, until that day of reckoning comes, we must pass this 
amendment to assure the Federal Government does not interfere with 
State-legal cannabis activities, and that we extend those same 
protections to Tribal interests.
  This modest extension of existing protections, which we have achieved 
through the appropriations process in the past, is critically important 
we retain and continue.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, this proposal that is being referred to 
here would prevent Federal law enforcement from enforcing current law, 
protecting public health, and ensuring community safety.
  Under the Controlled Substances Act, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration defines Schedule I drugs as ``having no currently 
accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.'' And according to 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse, there is scientifically ``no 
recognized medical benefit from smoking or eating marijuana plants.''
  Claims of benefits from smoked or ingested marijuana are very 
unreliable and generally outright fabrication. However, it is an 
established fact that marijuana use has real health and social harms. 
This is true especially in children; young people with developing 
brains and those with impaired physical or psychological conditions. 
And new data shows crime and health problems from marijuana use and 
trafficking, in particular, in States that have criminalized its use.
  Mr. Speaker, this amendment sends the wrong message about the most 
widely abused drug in the United States. It should be noted--and this 
is very important--according to the DEA, more young people receive 
treatment for marijuana dependency than for alcohol or all other 
illegal drugs combined. This amendment ignores the problems of abuse 
and sends the false message to youth that smoking marijuana is healthy.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the rejection of this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I would respectfully disagree. As a 
practical matter, it is easy to verify that it does have therapeutic 
value. That is why voters in 33 States have approved it.
  I have had experience with what has happened with our veterans, who 
make the strong argument that this has actually saved their lives: 
People with extreme nausea from chemotherapy. Babies with extreme 
seizure disorders are being tortured, and the only relief comes from 
the use of cannabis. That is why even States that haven't approved 
medical marijuana have passed it, because it works.

                              {time}  1315

  The existing scheduling is an outright lie. That is why we have 
problems, a Federal policy that is so out of touch with a majority of 
the American public, with objective evidence, what people have seen 
with their own eyes, protecting babies from being tortured or veterans 
with PTSD. That is one of the problems we have, a policy that is so out 
of sync that it is hard to convince children that they should believe 
the admonition.
  We ought to legalize it, tax it, regulate it, keep it out of hands of 
kids, but don't deal with what is, for many adults, a medicine or a 
choice in terms of what they want to do. This is where the American 
public has been going. The existing policy of prohibition is an abject 
failure.
  In the gentleman's home State, we watched, just this last week, a 
veteran from Phoenix driving to North Carolina was discovered to have 
medical marijuana in his possession and subject to a 5-year prison 
sentence.
  That is outrageous. That is not where the rest of America is. That is 
one of the reasons people are outraged in terms of Black Lives Matter. 
This selective enforcement of nonsensical policy has posed huge 
problems for Black Americans.
  I strongly urge approval of this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, let me just say, I know the gentleman from 
Oregon is very passionate, and I respect the gentleman very much, but I 
do want to say that this amendment ignores the problems of abuse. It 
sends a false message to our young people across this country that 
smoking marijuana is healthy. And I strongly urge the rejection of the 
amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that

               Amendment No. 148 Offered by Ms. Underwood

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
148 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division B (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may 
     be used by the Department of Justice to argue, in the conduct 
     of any litigation to which the United States, or an agency or 
     officer thereof is a party, that any provision of the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148; 124 
     Stat. 119) or of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation 
     Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), is unconstitutional or is 
     invalid or unenforceable on any ground, including that 
     certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act are not severable from section 5000A of that Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.

[[Page H4142]]

  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment, which will 
prevent Federal funds from being used by the Department of Justice to 
undermine the Affordable Care Act.
  After Republicans failed in their dozens of attempts to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act legislatively, they are now fighting in the courts 
to overturn the law in its entirety. My amendment will stop them.
  You see, if ACA is overturned, 23 million Americans would lose the 
affordable care they depend on; prescription drug costs would increase 
for seniors on Medicare; being a woman would once again be considered a 
preexisting condition; insurance companies would cap the benefits and 
kick children off their parents' plans before their 26th birthday; and 
130 million Americans with preexisting conditions would lose their 
protections.
  We simply cannot go back to those days.
  Affordable healthcare that covers preexisting conditions has always 
been crucial, but it has never been more important than right now.
  Today, over 4 million Americans have been diagnosed with the 
coronavirus, a new preexisting condition. Over 30 million Americans 
have lost their jobs, and over 5 million have lost their health 
insurance at the worst possible time.
  While this health and economic crisis has been unfolding, the Trump 
administration will not stop until they destroy the Affordable Care 
Act. Not even a once-in-a-generation global pandemic will keep them 
from coming for your healthcare.
  Well, not on my watch. As a nurse, and as an American with a 
preexisting condition, I understand personally why we must fight this 
with everything we have got: 130 million Americans depend on it.
  Today, we fight for them as we send a crystal-clear message to the 
Trump administration: Keep your hands off our healthcare.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, ObamaCare has been an unlawful failure. 
Fortunately, this administration remains committed to providing more 
affordable healthcare options to all Americans.
  Debating the prospects of future judicial action will not help us 
deliver on our promise to bring better healthcare to our constituents. 
Congress needs to work, rather, on a bipartisan basis, with the 
administration, to ensure quality, affordable care.
  In addition, it is not appropriate for Congress to tell the executive 
branch what positions it should take in court. Litigation strategy is 
the responsibility and the prerogative of the Department of Justice.
  The Attorney General, as the litigator for the United States, should 
be able to advance what he believes are defensible and reasonable legal 
positions. The Attorney General has concluded that the position of the 
States challenging the ACA and the district court is a defensible and 
reasonable legal position for the department to take.
  Questions of the constitutionality should be determined by the 
courts, not through a partisan debate on a funding limitation to an 
appropriations bill, which we are doing this afternoon.
  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Kansas (Ms. Davids).
  Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
amendment introduced by Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, which would 
prevent the Department of Justice from spending taxpayer dollars on a 
lawsuit that would tear down the landmark Affordable Care Act.
  To effectively fight the coronavirus, we have to make sure that every 
person has access to affordable, quality healthcare. But even during a 
global pandemic, when so many people are finding themselves without 
health insurance, this administration is determined to eliminate every 
last protection and benefit afforded by the ACA.
  These benefits include allowing young adults to stay on their 
parents' plan until age 26, ensuring women and men are charged the same 
rates, and protecting people with preexisting conditions, things like 
asthma and diabetes.
  If this lawsuit is successful, 94,000 Kansans would lose their 
healthcare coverage, people like Danny Robeson. I met Danny when he was 
7. He lives in Prairie Village, in the district that I represent.
  He was born prematurely, has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and a cortical 
vision impairment, health conditions that surely are considered 
preexisting conditions. Without the protections of the ACA, his family 
fears that they would go bankrupt and be unable to get Danny the care 
he needs.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman.
  Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, during this time of uncertainty, 
no Kansan should have to worry about whether they will afford the care 
that they or their families need to stay healthy.
  We should build on the progress of the ACA, not tear it down.
  I urge my fellow colleagues to support the amendment introduced by 
Representative Underwood.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would oppose this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. Craig).

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment.
  Our work to lower healthcare costs for working families could not be 
more urgent. I am here to say that we will not fund the 
administration's attempts through litigation to threaten and tear down 
the critical protections of the Affordable Care Act.
  Fifty-one percent of the non-elderly in my district in Minnesota have 
a preexisting condition and rely on the ACA's critical protections. If 
the ACA were repealed, 35,000 of my constituents would lose healthcare 
coverage.
  To these Minnesotans, the results would be life-threatening and 
financially devastating. We cannot allow that to happen. We need to 
build on the ACA, not tear it down.
  That is exactly why I introduced the bipartisan State Health Care 
Premium Reduction Act to lower the costs of healthcare for those in the 
individual marketplace, and it is why I am proud to support this 
amendment today.
  I urge my colleagues to join us in fighting to preserve and build 
upon healthcare for millions of Americans.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. Axne).
  Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to cosponsor this amendment 
today, to ensure that no taxpayer dollars go toward advancing a lawsuit 
that literally threatens the livelihood of millions of Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, since 2017, we have seen an administration obsessed with 
undermining, sabotaging, and repealing a law that protects millions 
living with preexisting conditions in this country.
  As we end another month of a devastating health crisis that has taken 
the lives of 150,000 Americans, they are doubling down and insisting--
and I quote their own words here--``the ACA must fall.''
  This isn't only extraordinarily tone-deaf. It is playing politics 
with the lives of people in this country, including Iowans.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from Illinois 
has expired.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

[[Page H4143]]

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


                Amendment No. 149 Offered by Mr. Walberg

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
149 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division B (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may 
     be used to carry out Order Number 3946-2017 of the Attorney 
     General, issued July 19, 2017.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support my bipartisan amendment, which 
would help provide critical protections for all Americans and their 
right to due process under the Constitution.
  My amendment would prohibit the use of funds for the Department of 
Justice to implement its adoptive seizures policy. These forfeiture 
adoptions provide a loophole that helps law enforcement evade stricter 
laws governing civil asset forfeiture by seizing property and 
transferring it to Federal authorities in exchange for up to 80 percent 
of future proceeds.

                              {time}  1330

  Now, while I support law enforcement and oppose the ridiculous idea 
to defund law enforcement, for many years I have worked in a bipartisan 
way to highlight civil asset forfeiture abuses and call for reform to 
the practice. And I thank my colleagues, Representatives Raskin, Amash, 
Rush, Gabbard, and McClintock, for joining me on this bipartisan effort 
today.
  The Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund contains proceeds 
from equitable sharing agreements between the Federal Government and 
local law enforcement. These arrangements create perverse incentives to 
seek out forfeiture opportunities, and it is used to circumvent State-
enacted--like Michigan's--civil asset forfeiture reforms.
  In recent years, we have learned of a growing number of instances 
across the United States where the government has confiscated property 
from citizens and small businesses without any criminal conviction or 
any criminal charges being brought. Moreover, civil forfeiture 
disproportionately affects minorities and individuals who cannot afford 
to represent themselves.
  Mr. Speaker, current civil forfeiture practices are deeply unpopular 
with the public, and there is strong bipartisan support for reform. As 
such, proponents for reforming forfeiture practices include a broad 
coalition, like the ACLU, FreedomWorks, the NAACP, and Americans for 
Prosperity.
  Mr. Speaker, the current civil asset forfeiture system is ripe for 
abuse and has undermined the constitutional rights of far too many 
Americans. This amendment has already passed the House twice by voice 
vote. I ask my colleagues to once again support this bipartisan 
amendment and protect the right of due process for all Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I am opposing the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. As a Member in true opposition, the 
gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this amendment.
  While I greatly respect the gentleman from Michigan and I know that 
he feels very strongly about this issue, this amendment would reverse 
the July 2017 order from the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, which 
included safeguards to ensure adoptive seizures that are legal and 
conform to the Department of Justice policy.
  Adoptive seizures allow the Federal Government to recover funds that 
are proceeds of or connected to Federal crimes, but where property 
happens to be discovered by local law enforcement. Moreover, this type 
of Federal and local cooperation fosters important collaboration 
between agents and officers.
  We should not return hastily to the Obama administration policy but, 
rather, continue to review carefully the practice of forfeiture 
adoption as part of the broader discussion of asset forfeiture reform.
  Violent crime, gangs, and drug trafficking are a growing and 
continuing problem across this Nation. We should not take away from law 
enforcement a tool they need to combat criminal groups and to make our 
streets safer.
  So, again, we would love to work with the gentleman on this, but I 
would have to recommend a ``no'' on this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague from Michigan for 
his leadership on this very important bipartisan issue.
  There should not be much dispute around the constitutional basis for 
the need of this change. In plain language, civil forfeiture basically 
allows police to seize, keep, or sell any property they allege is 
involved with a crime. Owners of that property may never be arrested or 
convicted of a crime, but they will see their money or their cars or 
their homes be promptly taken away permanently.
  Now, in 2017, the Department of Justice expanded civil asset 
forfeiture, allowing local law enforcement to bypass State laws and 
seize property from people with the lowest possible burden of evidence, 
again, regardless of whether or not that person was ever convicted or 
even charged with a crime.
  Furthermore, it puts the burden of proof on the private citizen to go 
through the bureaucracy and the red tape to attempt to reclaim their 
property, which is extremely difficult to do. This violates the very 
principle of our justice system: innocent until proven guilty.
  It is a violation of the Fifth Amendment, which says: ``No person 
shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of 
law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just 
compensation.''
  Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense, bipartisan measure. I am proud to 
stand in strong support and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that the current 
forfeiture system is ripe for abuse, and it has undermined the 
constitutional rights of far too many Americans. This amendment has 
already passed the House twice by voice vote. We support it here.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to once again support this 
bipartisan amendment and protect the right of due process for all 
Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I again want to oppose this amendment, and I firmly 
believe we should not take away from law enforcement a tool that they 
need to combat criminal groups and make our streets safer.
  Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) and the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Calvert) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).
  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative   
Michael Burgess, who has been my bipartisan partner in this effort to 
affect positively those individuals who suffer from sickle cell anemia.
  The Davis-Burgess amendment will add $2 million to the Centers for 
Disease Control's National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental 
Disabilities' Public Health Approach to Blood Disorders account to fund 
a surveillance program in sickle cell disease and reduce the 
administration account in the Office of the Secretary of Health and 
Human Service's account by a similar amount.
  This same bipartisan amendment was offered last year by me, 
Representative Burgess, Representative Butterfield, and passed a roll 
call vote of 410-12, 410 yes, 12 noes.
  I urge passage because what it does is set up a separate account for 
sickle cell anemia in the National Institutes of Health. It has no 
bearing on the budget, and I urge passage.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to this en bloc 
amendment.
  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson).
  Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an amendment I 
offered alongside Representatives Cisneros, Larsen, and Young. This 
amendment would increase funding to Small Business Development Centers 
by $5 million by fiscal year 2021.
  SBDCs provide a critical resource to small business owners and 
entrepreneurs who use the centers for free consulting and at-cost 
trainings. SBDCs have a return on investment of over two to one, and 
last year they helped generate $7 billion in new sales. It will be even 
more valuable as our small businesses recover from this pandemic.
  As a Member of the House Small Business Committee, I have seen 
firsthand how effective SBDCs can be for our Nation's economic engine. 
Now, more than ever, we need to strengthen our support for small 
business programs.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on this 
amendment and support Main Streets across America.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chair of the Committee on Education and 
Labor.

[[Page H4147]]

  

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my two 
amendments to H.R. 7617.
  My first amendment is offered with Virginia Representatives Wittman, 
Luria, and Beyer and reflects the need to adequately fund the important 
work done at Jefferson Lab.
  JLab conducts primary research in subatomic particles, but the $2 
million included in this year's bill falls short of the $9 million 
needed to move forward with the renovation and expansion to JLab, which 
the Department of Energy has already approved.
  I also rise in support of my amendment offered with Virginia 
Representatives Wittman, McEachin, Luria, Spanberger, and Wexton in 
regard to the urgent need for robust funding for the U.S. Corps of 
Engineers for coastal construction projects. The Port of Virginia and 
the Corps of Engineers have already undertaken the dredging, widening, 
and deepening of the Norfolk Harbor to enable safe and efficient two-
way passage of the new larger container ships. The project will require 
additional funds and a New Start designation to keep the projected 
timeline intact.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting additional funding to 
keep both of these essential projects moving forward and on schedule.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Zeldin).
  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.
  I rise today in support of my bipartisan amendment to halt the sale 
and marketing of Plum Island, New York, by the General Services 
Administration.
  Situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound, Plum Island is 
treasured by our local community in both New York and Connecticut.
  Since World War II, Plum Island has been utilized as a research 
laboratory. In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security, which 
currently has jurisdiction over the island, announced that the Animal 
Disease Center would be moved to a new Federal facility in Kansas.
  To offset the cost of this relocation, a law was enacted in 2008 that 
called for the sale of Plum Island to the highest bidder.
  However, according to a DHS report issued in April 2016, the new site 
in Kansas is already fully paid for through a combination of Federal 
appropriations and funding from the State of Kansas.
  The current law is the wrong path forward. The better way is to 
provide for public access, permanent preservation of Plum Island, and 
continued use of the state-of-the-art research infrastructure.
  That is why I have been working with my colleague from Connecticut, 
Congressman   Joe Courtney, and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers 
from both sides of Long Island Sound to repeal this flawed mandate.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues' support.

                              {time}  1345

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. Loebsack).
  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc package, which 
includes my amendment to increase investment of distributed wind 
technologies and research within the Department of Energy's Wind Energy 
Program.
  Distributed wind is the use of typically smaller wind turbines owned 
primarily by rural and local entities, such as homes, farms, 
businesses, and public facilities to offset all or a portion of onsite 
energy consumption.
  This type of energy production strengthens American communities by 
helping them become more energy independent while lowering costs for 
consumers. Distributed wind also strengthens domestic manufacturing, 
and, in fact, American-made wind turbines can be found in well over 100 
countries around the world.

  The funding provided over the past few fiscal years has helped 
unleash distributed wind power's vast potential, but continued 
investment is needed to support the critical research and development 
that will further reduce costs and maximize the benefits of distributed 
wind power.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding.
  I rise today in support of my amendment that requires the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to coordinate with the heads of the 
relevant agencies to compile a list of critical medications the Federal 
Government should ensure are readily available in the event of another 
public health emergency.
  In recent decades, the United States has become more reliant on 
foreign countries for the production of general pharmaceutical drugs. 
Today, only a small portion of generic drugs are produced in the United 
States. That is one thing that the coronavirus pandemic has taught us 
is that we should not be reliant on our adversaries for our generic 
drugs.
  Hostile authoritarian regimes like the Chinese Communist Party should 
never have the ability to decide the drugs that American people have 
access to. We cannot allow China to hold American lives in its hands.
  My amendment will ensure we are properly informed about our 
pharmaceutical supply chains.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. Heck).
  Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the en bloc group 
of amendments including mine, bipartisan amendment No. 318, to increase 
funding for the Indian Community Development Block Grant.
  This is about creating jobs and addressing housing needs in Indian 
Country.
  For far too long, native communities have experienced poverty and 
overcrowded, dilapidated housing at a rate much higher than the rest of 
the Nation.
  My bipartisan amendment would help Tribes address these longstanding 
challenges by increasing funding for the Indian Community Development 
Block Grant by $5 million.
  Boosting funding for this program is a small yet meaningful step to 
improve housing and economic opportunities in Indian Country.
  But we can't stop there. We must continue our work to improve housing 
in native communities.
  I thank Representatives Young, Haaland, Moore, Gabbard, and Huffman 
for cosponsoring this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the 
great State of Alaska (Mr. Young).
  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and thank 
him for his good work on this bill.
  My amendment supports the important Water Power Technologies Office 
in the Department of Energy.
  This office offers grants to deploy hydropower, pumped storage, and 
marine energy projects and related transmission infrastructure in low-
income, economically distressed, underserved, or rural communities.
  Hydropower is clean and produces no emissions and uses the energy of 
running water without reducing its quantity to produce electricity.
  My State of Alaska has tremendous hydropower potential. While 
Alaska's total energy consumption is among the 10 lowest States, its 
per capita energy consumption is fourth highest in the United States 
because of our small population, terrain, and geographic parameters.
  Mr. Speaker, the cost of electricity in Alaska can be twice that of 
the lower 48.
  This increased cost of power in the residential sector has 
significant economic impacts on Alaskan families.
  Many communities rely on expensive diesel generation for electricity 
and home heating.
  This amendment offers support for hydropower projects, provides many 
residents and businesses of Alaska with low-cost, renewable, clean 
power.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc and my 
amendment that is included in it.
  I am speaking on behalf of our rural communities that face many 
challenges in making sure that goods and

[[Page H4148]]

services are accessible to residents and small businesses and that they 
actually remain affordable. Communities like mine are no different 
where, in many cases, air travel island-by-island is the only means of 
access available.
  For things such as medical appointments, visiting family, getting to 
school, commuting to work or meeting local business needs and more, air 
travel is a lifeline.
  A national one-size-fits-all regulation on Essential Air Service 
fails to acknowledge our unique travel needs and geographic realities.
  This amendment extends protections for communities in Hawaii and 
Pennsylvania that Congress has long recognized and ensures our rural 
populations maintain access to critical transportation resources.
  This bipartisan effort eliminates the cost-sharing requirement and 
makes sure that our local communities in rural areas remain connected.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this amendment.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for 
the opportunity to offer my crucial amendment that will help the five 
sovereign Chippewa Tribes in my district: The Bois Forte Band, the Fond 
du Lac, the Grand Portage, the Leech Lake, and the Mille Lacs Band.

  Northern Minnesota Tribes provide cultural perspective that enrich 
and inform my policymaking. However, Indian Country has endured a 
crisis unlike any other.
  Suicide among American Indian and Alaska Natives is a devastating 
epidemic impacting the communities in my district and across our 
Nation.
  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American 
Indians and Alaska Natives have the highest rate of suicide of any 
ethnic group in the United States, and it has steadily been increasing 
since 2003. To this day, suicide is the second leading cause of death 
among native youth between the ages of 15 and 24.
  Despite this startling trend, funding for Native American suicide 
prevention programs within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration was level funded from last year.
  Level funding is not enough. We need these funds to strengthen 
community-driven and informed approaches to reduce suicide among native 
populations.
  Mr. Speaker, my amendment today nearly doubles funding for Native 
American suicide prevention programs. These crucial resources within 
SAMHSA will benefit Native American and Alaska Native youth everywhere.
  For example, the renowned Indian Health Services facility in Bemidji, 
Minnesota, serves 34 Tribes in the Midwest covering my district and 
well beyond. With increased funding from this amendment, they would be 
able to provide more suicide and mental health services and outreach to 
our communities.
  Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank my partner in 
addressing this issue, the dean of the House,   Don Young, from the 
great State of Alaska.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for my amendment and, in turn, support 
for ending the longstanding and devastating epidemic in Indian Country 
that is suicide.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).
  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to 
address current IRS backlogs.
  Over the past few months, I have heard from constituents across 
central Virginia who have not yet received their recovery rebate checks 
or their 2019 Federal tax refunds.
  Congress created the recovery rebate program to address the economic 
crisis caused by COVID-19, and as families struggle waiting for IRS 
checks to arrive, we know that the taxpayer correspondence which is 
necessary to process these checks and tax returns is currently sitting 
in trailers and office space leased specifically to store the backlog 
of mail.
  This backlog is unacceptable, and Congress must take action to make 
clear that this backlog must be addressed, and we must give IRS the 
tools they need to address it and make clear our expectations that they 
will.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LaMalfa).
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from southern 
California for yielding.
  I refer back to amendment No. 87 that would prohibit expenditure 
funds by DOJ for marijuana enforcement eradication.
  Now, we have a huge problem in my part of northern California, and 
this isn't just what some may look at as a State's rights issue. This 
is a problem. We have a 50-State standard for FDA legalization of 
drugs, and we are going to have a willy-nilly hopscotch way of doing 
things with every State that wants to legalize it doing their own 
thing. What it really boils down to is this is still in violation of 
Federal law by legalizing marijuana. So we should continue to enforce 
it.
  Empowering States to legalize it doesn't stop illegal drug 
trafficking. Indeed, it just brings it into town. It brings it closer 
and increases illegal drug trafficking from my State out to other 
States.
  The cartels get even more nasty about this. Drug cartels have moved 
on to our public lands and caused great amounts of damage clearcutting 
trees, killing wildlife with their chemicals, and trying to keep them 
away.
  The DEA Cannabis Eradication Program found a 60 percent increase in 
the amount of assets seized from raids in busting these grows.
  The same year, the Forest Service eradicated nearly $1.5 million 
worth of plants, so this is 2016, from 247 sites on national forest 
lands in California alone. And those are 4-year-old stats because it 
keeps going up.
  The amount of damage they are doing and what it means to nearby 
farmers and ranchers who have a very low tolerance for what they are 
allowed to get away with on their operations is really unfair.
  Of course, these cartels are very heavily armed, and anybody that 
happens to go in there hunting or hiking or just traipsing around, 
their life is in danger because these people enforce very strongly on 
their grows.
  They plague our forests. Many of my colleagues have a bipartisan bill 
called the PLANT Act to help the Federal Government and local law 
enforcement address this problem and increase penalties and do a better 
job of enforcing in our forests because they are damaging them. It is 
dangerous to our communities in those areas.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an 
additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. LaMALFA. So before we do anything that makes marijuana 
legalization easier or simpler, we must consider the side effects of 
this legalization and looking the other way on enforcement of marijuana 
on our lands.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Panetta).
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7617 and my 
amendment for funding the Education for Homeless Children and Youth 
Program.
  This funding is necessary because homelessness affects students all 
across our Nation, including in my district on the central coast of 
California.
  In Monterey County, nearly 10,000 students meet the formal definition 
of homelessness. More specifically, in Salinas, over 3,500 students are 
homeless. That is 40 percent of the school district.
  We can and we must do better. And we can start with this bill and my 
amendment that identifies homeless youth, funds local liaisons, ensures 
support services, and coordinates with the community to meet the basic 
needs of our children.
  Let's pass this bill with my amendment so that we can give homeless 
students greater support for a more promising future.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. Schrier).
  Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that this amendment 
addressing antibiotic resistance has been included in this package.
  While today we are laser focused on COVID-19, our next pandemic could 
be a ``super bug.''

[[Page H4149]]

  The antibiotics we have relied on for years are no match for the 
drug-resistant bacteria that infect more than 2.8 million people each 
year.
  As a pediatrician, I want to make sure that in 10 years I will still 
be able to treat my patients' bacterial infections like pneumonia, C. 
diff, meningitis, and abscesses.
  In order to do that we need to curtail the current overuse of 
antibiotics and make investments in developing new ones now.
  That is why Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, or CARB-X, is so 
important. By funding early phases of research for promising new 
antibiotics, this public-private partnership minimizes the risk that 
discourages investment in new treatments.

                              {time}  1400

  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Visclosky for his 
hard work here.
  I rise in support of this en bloc package, which contains two 
amendments I introduced.
  My first amendment will give all of Congress access to weekly updates 
on inventory in our Strategic National Stockpile. We all need current 
information on our Nation's supply chain and our inventory of PPE, 
vaccine materials, and supplies as we respond to this crisis, 
especially for my district, which has been hit so hard in northern New 
Jersey.
  My second amendment prioritizes clean drinking water, because every 
child should have access to lead-free water at school.
  I am proud my other two amendments were included in other en bloc 
packages to increase investment for broadband infrastructure, so we can 
address the challenges facing underserved areas, especially as families 
are working and learning online.
  My final amendment, which has been adopted, supports improving our 
Nation's manufacturing supply chain to address the challenges caused by 
COVID.
  I have worked closely with the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension 
Program as we help ensure small and mid-size manufacturers in New 
Jersey have the equipment they need.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc set of 
amendments.
  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, COVID-19 weighs heavily on our 
communities. The pandemic has increased isolation, anxiety, and 
economic stress for millions of Americans, and we have seen a sharp 
increase in overdoses across the country.
  The Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program tracks overdoses 
and has documented a 42 percent increase in suspected overdoses 
compared to the data from May 2019. In New Jersey, State health 
officials say there has been a 20 percent increase in overdose deaths 
since May.
  The Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training program is 
critical to ensuring the necessary resources and training for medical 
practitioners and mental health professionals. This program makes 
grants to institutions, including medical schools and federally-
qualified health centers, to support training for medical residents and 
fellows in psychiatry and addiction medicine, as well as nurse 
practitioners, physician assistants, and others to provide substance 
use treatment in underserved communities.
  My amendment highlights the critical nature of these programs, and I 
applaud the committee for increasing funding for this training to 
support the mental and physical health of Americans.
  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. Espaillat).
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for more than 
three decades of valuable service to our Nation.
  I joined Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee on an amendment that 
directs NIAID, led by Dr. Anthony Fauci, to prioritize minority patient 
outreach and minority candidate inclusion in COVID-19 critical clinical 
trials or therapy development.
  I worked with Chairman Raul Grijalva on an amendment that supports 
English language acquisition grants used by school districts and 
teachers that teach English language learners, like myself, that sat in 
the back of a classroom for 2 years not knowing what was being said.
  I have worked for the past 2 years with my colleague Jose Serrano on 
the National Science Foundation's STEM undergraduate program for 
Hispanic-serving institutions.
  Finally, Madam Speaker, I am glad we included my critical amendment 
to prohibit the Office of Refugee Resettlement from contracting with 
for-profit contractors to house unaccompanied alien children.
  That is a private sector money grab that benefits from children that 
are split, ripped apart from their parents' arms.
  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. Stevens).
  Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment on 
drowning prevention in H.R. 7617.
  This amendment emphasizes the pressing need to appropriate $5 million 
to the CDC to continue its lifesaving work on water safety and drowning 
prevention.
  This amendment is in memory of Jacob Sandy, a loving brother and son, 
who drowned off the coast of Lake Michigan just over a year ago.
  Jacob graduated from Seaholm High School, my alma mater. His young 
adult life was just beginning, and he was known for his deep Christian 
faith, his positive outlook, adventurous and humorous spirit.
  Now that summer is in full swing, it is time for us to ensure that no 
one has to experience the pain suffered by his mother, Carol, his 
brother, Paul, his sister, Charlotte, and the countless others who 
loved him.
  There is so much more we can do to prevent drownings in America.
  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).
  Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, American doctors, scientists, and 
researchers aren't alone in racing to unlock treatments, vaccines, and 
other lifesaving developments in the fight against COVID-19.
  Their counterparts in Israel are making groundbreaking advancements 
as well.
  Just days ago, an Israeli study indicated that low levels of vitamin 
D increase the risk of contracting COVID. Israeli scientists are 
developing six different vaccine candidates and more than a dozen 
different treatment options for the deadly lung inflammation caused by 
COVID-19.
  That is why I am asking my colleagues to support this bipartisan 
amendment which will fund a new partnership between the U.S. and Israel 
to bring leading researchers together to defeat this devastating 
disease.
  By passing this amendment, we can deepen our expertise in the 
development of drugs, vaccines, AI solutions, respiratory assist 
devices, diagnostic tests, telemedicine, and more to help save American 
lives.
  America can't go it alone in this fight. We are stronger when we join 
forces with countries that share our values to confront our shared 
challenges.
  Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this provision.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I support the 
en bloc amendment, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of 
En Bloc No. 4, to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science, 
Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General 
Government, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, 
Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act.

[[Page H4150]]

  I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for including 
several amendments in the Rule for House consideration of H.R. 7617.
  The Jackson Lee amendments are in the following Divisions:
  Division A--Department of Defense;
  Division B--Commerce, Justice, Science;
  Division F--Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; and
  Division G--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 319, included in En Bloc No. 4, increases 
and decreases the National Infrastructure Investments account by 
$2,000,000 to emphasize support for urban bicycle and pedestrian safety 
programs.
  I wish to thank the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO 
and for voicing support for this Jackson Lee Amendment.
  On March 30, 2019, in the city of Houston, at the intersection of 
North Shepherd Drive and West 10th Street located in the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, Lesha White, 54, was driving with her 
daughters when she saw Jesus ``Jesse'' Perez struggling to cross the 
intersection in a wheelchair.
  Ms. White pulled over and got out of her car to help Mr. Perez cross 
the street when another vehicle struck them, and they were both killed.
  On March 7, 2019, 23-year-old David Leon Loya was killed in a 
collision with a school bus while riding his bicycle in The Heights 
area of Houston.
  Police report that Mr. Loya was in the bike lane and tried to avoid 
the accident by sliding under the bus, but unfortunately, he was run 
over by the back axle.
  This young man was greatly loved by his family, the lives of the 
people he touched in his volunteer work, and the bicyclist community.
  I offered the amendment in remembrance of Lesha White, Jesus 
``Jesse'' Perez, David Leon Loya, and all of the other pedestrians and 
bicyclists who have lost their lives in accidents with motor vehicles 
in urban areas.
  In the past sixteen years, the Houston area has seen 2,000 deaths of 
bicyclists and pedestrians, at an average of 100 a year, with the last 
three years seeing the rate increase to 150 a year, according to 
federal statistics.
  In 2017, the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics are 
available, according to the Texas Department of Transportation 
(``TDOT''), the numbers were no more encouraging.
  According to TDOT, 1,409 Houston-area pedestrians were injured in 
roadways crashes:
  275 of them were injured seriously;
  146 pedestrians were killed in roadways crashes;
  639 bicyclists were injured in roadways crashes; and
  82 bicyclists were injured seriously.
  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has called the 
number of deaths a ``public health crisis.''
  The problem is no more encouraging on the national level as Texas 
ranks third nationwide in bicycle deaths, behind California and 
Florida.
  Nationwide, the number of fatal bicyclist accidents is rising and are 
also amounting to a greater percentage of total traffic fatalities.
  Cities are uniquely susceptible to this problem, as the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 70 percent of 
bicycle fatalities occur in cities.
  I offered this amendment that was included in the FY 2020 
Transportation Appropriations bill that is law today because funding is 
needed to make changes to the intersections to improve pedestrian and 
bicyclists safety.
  We must come together to tackle this problem and work to ensure that 
we stem the tide in these fatalities.
  The rising death and injury toll of pedestrian and bicyclists is 
alarming and merits serious attention but as we know too tragically, 
behind the statistics are stories about people who are treasured and 
sorely missed by family, friends, and coworkers.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 251, included in En Bloc No. 4, increases 
and decreases funds by $10,000,000 increase in funding to support 
greater diversity in the pool of diabetes research professionals and 
patients participating in clinical trials.
  Diversity in medical trials is essential to ensuring that cures, 
especially vaccines, and therapies work for the greatest number of 
persons impacted by an illness.
  34.2 million people, or 10.5 percent of the U.S. population, have 
diabetes. An estimated 26.8 million people--or 10.2 percent of the 
population--have been diagnosed with diabetes. Approximately 7.3 
million people have diabetes but have not yet been diagnosed (2018).
  Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds.
  Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5.2 percent of all diagnosed cases 
of diabetes, affecting approximately 1.6 million people.
  African American adults are 60 percent more likely than non-Hispanic 
white adults to have been diagnosed with diabetes by a physician.
  In 2016, non-Hispanic blacks were 3.5 times more likely to be 
diagnosed with end stage renal disease as compared to non-Hispanic 
whites.
  In 2016, non-Hispanic blacks were 2.3 times more likely to be 
hospitalized for lower limb amputations as compared to non-Hispanic 
whites.
  In 2017, African Americans were twice as likely as non-Hispanic 
whites to die from diabetes.
  This Jackson Lee Amendment focuses efforts on addressing lower 
participation rates of African Americans with diabetes in clinical 
trials that test treatments and therapies.
  I thank those who are instrumental in setting up clinical trials of 
the COVID-19 vaccine for focuses on increasing African American and 
Hispanic participation in the trial involving tens of thousands of 
Americans across the nation.
  This work, like what is proposed by this Jackson Lee amendment, is 
intended to make cures as effective as possible for the greatest number 
of persons.
  I am pleased to cosponsor Congressman Espaillat's Amendment No. 236 
included in En Bloc No. 4 to provide the increases and decreases by 
$10,000,000 to support greater minority patient outreach and minority 
candidate inclusion by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases in clinical trial participation for any vaccine or 
therapeutics to treat the novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 252, included in En Bloc No. 4, increases 
and decreases funds by $10,000,000 with the intent of supporting 
programs that provide outreach and support services targeting program 
participants at greatest risk of not completing a college degree due to 
COVID-19 education disruption.
  I urge my fellow members to vote in favor of En Bloc No. 4 and 
support these Jackson Lee Amendments.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Barragan). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1067, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


      Amendments En Bloc No. 5 Offered by Mr. Visclosky of Indiana

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1067, I 
offer amendments en bloc.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendments en 
bloc.
  Amendments en bloc No. 5 consisting of amendment Nos. 151, 152, 154, 
155, 158, 165, 166, 167, 168, 173, 177, 179, 185, 186, 189, 194, 196,

322, 323, 327, 331, 332, and 339, printed in part B of House Report 
116-461, offered by Mr. Visclosky of Indiana:
  Mr. LUJAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to 
support Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers.
  Our country and my home state of New Mexico have made progress in 
addressing the opioid crisis, but the United States is still falling 
far short of ensuring that everyone struggling with a substance use 
disorder can access the treatment they need. Recovery is not a one-
size-fits-all approach--it needs to be tailored to each person's unique 
needs.
  In 2018, Congress passed the overwhelmingly bipartisan SUPPORT for 
Patients and Communities Act. This legislation included new grants for 
Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers--facilities that provide the full 
continuum of treatment services, including all FDA-approved methods of 
medication assisted treatment, peer support, and wrap-around services 
for families. These Centers can help us identify what works and develop 
best practices to improve treatment everywhere.
  Last year, Congress provided $2 million for the first round of 
funding for two Centers, which will be awarded this fall. My amendment 
increases funding to $10 million, the full amount authorized by the 
SUPPORT Act, to fund 10 Centers to serve some of the hardest-hit 
communities and build the evidence needed to improve treatment across 
the country.
  Thank you to Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Pappas for joining me on this 
amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote YES.
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, every day 
Americans communicate with loved ones, receive medication, and during 
this pandemic, millions more than usual will vote all by mail.
  Yet drastic, negative changes are being made by new Postal Service 
leadership.

[[Page H4151]]

  Mail is being delivered later than normal, overtime is being 
eliminated, and carriers are being told to leave mail at distribution 
centers.
  The Administration's new Postmaster General is treating the Postal 
Service like a company, not a constitutionally mandated service for all 
Americans.
  My amendment would stop the Postal Service from implementing new 
standards that will result in later mail delivery and worse service.
  Now more than ever it is critical that the Postal Service continue to 
perform its mission without having to worry about cutting corners to 
cut costs.
  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment, 
which emphasizes the need to provide adequate funding for construction 
of the Department of Energy (DOE)'s Versatile Neutron Source or 
Versatile Test Reactor.
  The Versatile Test Reactor is a critical piece of DOE R&D 
infrastructure that will allow U.S. nuclear researchers to test and 
validate a wide range of advanced nuclear reactor designs on U.S. soil. 
Any responsible U.S. nuclear energy strategy must include robust 
support for this user facility.
  Last Congress, my bill, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities 
Act (NEICA), was the first step towards making this DOE user facility a 
reality. To build on the success of NEICA, the central piece of my 
nuclear legislation this Congress, H.R. 6796, the Nuclear Energy for 
the Future Act, is the authorization of full funding for this necessary 
work.
  That's why I am very concerned to see that the 2021 appropriations 
bill provides less than a quarter of the funds needed to keep the 
Versatile Test Reactor project on budget and on schedule. If we are 
serious about our clean energy future and if we want to decrease our 
dependence on competitors like China and Russia for advanced nuclear 
R&D, we must continue to strengthen our advanced nuclear energy 
industry by prioritizing our investment in essential research 
infrastructure.
  The United States should lead the world in advanced nuclear research 
and development. I believe that this amendment identifies one of the 
fundamental and immediate needs of the U.S. nuclear industry and 
provides a strong commitment to addressing it. Moving forward, I will 
continue to work with my colleagues to prioritize fundamental research 
that will support nuclear innovation and keep America safe, 
independent, and globally competitive.
  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment 
No. 340 in En Bloc 4 to provide $9 million to the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) to continue its work developing the remote tower 
pilot program.
  The remote tower pilot program is a simple and cost-effective way to 
provide air traffic control services to an airport from any location. 
Remote towers use a network of high-definition cameras and sensors to 
feed real-time information to air traffic controllers, who can be 
located at the airport or at a separate remote tower center. Remote 
tower infrastructure is cheaper, more flexible, and requires less 
extensive maintenance and upkeep than manned air traffic control 
towers, allowing the FAA and airports to address their air traffic 
control needs more cheaply. Remote towers also provide controllers with 
additional capabilities, including night vision with infrared cameras, 
enhanced visibility in poor weather or low light conditions, views of 
high-traffic areas or blind spots, moving object tracking, and real-
time data overlays.
  I am very pleased that the first remote tower in the U.S. is 
currently being tested at Leesburg Executive Airport in Virginia's 10th 
Congressional District. Launched in 2014, remote tower technology has 
provided Leesburg with air traffic control capabilities without having 
to construct a manned air traffic control tower. These capabilities 
support Leesburg's more than 100,000 annual operations in highly 
complex airspace due to the airport's proximity to Dulles International 
Airport.
  The remote tower pilot program at Leesburg has been a great success, 
and my amendment will ensure that the FAA can continue this work at 
Leesburg and at new pilot sites around the country to further develop 
these important technologies. I thank the Committee for the inclusion 
of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to H.R. 7617, Division F--of the Defense, 
Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development, Financial 
Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing, and Urban 
Development Appropriations Act of 2021. My amendment, included in the 
bipartisan en bloc, will increase funding for the Institute of Museum 
and Library Services account by $10 million to support technological 
advancements in libraries. This amendment highlights the need for 
technology, like Wi-Fi and computers, in libraries, especially in 
communities that are economically distressed. With uncertainty around 
school openings in the fall, many students may not have the technology 
or internet available at home to succeed. Libraries are a great place 
to offer these types of free community services in a safe environment. 
My amendment would support the bolstering of these resources. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation.
  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment, number 187 and part of en bloc package number four, which 
would direct the Department of Energy (DOE) to continue spending $10 
million on the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response 
(HAZWOPER) worker training program in fiscal year 2021.
  HAZWOPER is implemented by the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences (NIEHS). Through grants to outside organizations and 
labor groups, NIEHS is able to provide training for both communities 
near DOE sites and workers at such locations in hazardous waste and 
material clean up as well as emergency response in the event of a 
hazardous material release.
  Many different categories of worker receive this preparation; some 
examples include carpenters, firefighters, machinists, and truck 
drivers. Their training can involve dealing with site-specific issues, 
such as superfund locations, job-specific challenges, and dangerous 
substances, including radiological materials, lead, and asbestos.
  Since the program started in 1993, over 622,000 workers have received 
a total of more than eight million hours of training at dozens of sites 
around the country. One of those sites is in my congressional district, 
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
  HAZWOPER thus helps protect staff, work sites, and communities from 
hazardous materials and emergency situations involving DOE operations. 
It is a vital program that should be continued.
  I urge all Members to support my amendment.

     214.103(n)(4)).
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) and the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Diaz-Balart) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Levin).
  Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding the time.
  I rise in support of this en bloc package, which includes three of my 
amendments.
  My first amendment prioritizes funding to support labor reforms in 
Mexico that will improve Mexican and U.S. workers' standards of living 
so the USMCA can fulfill its promise.
  The second prioritizes BUILD grant funding for green infrastructure 
projects that will decarbonize and electrify U.S. ground 
transportation.
  My final amendment prohibits Secretary DeVos from funneling public 
school money to private schools through so-called Education Freedom 
Scholarships.
  These amendments protect workers, promote investments in green 
infrastructure, and safeguard public education.
  Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for considering them and I urge my 
colleagues to support this package.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the dean of the House of 
Representatives of the United States.
  Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, my good friend, 
for yielding to me.
  You know, the legislation we have been talking about has a lot of 
good merits, but I was on the floor last week talking about the mice 
that get into a good bill and destroy it by leaving residue behind. It 
appears to me now that there is a rat in this bill that is leaving a 
lot more behind.
  I am talking about an amendment that is offered on the Pebble Mine 
that hijacks due process and the scientific process that the sponsors 
of this amendment claim to hold so near and dear to their hearts.
  The Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, 
are bedrock environmental statutes and they should not be preempted or 
short-circuited when it is convenient for groups on either side of the 
issue.
  The sponsors of this amendment claim the administration is unraveling 
NEPA, but it is this amendment that would stymie the process, and it is 
disingenuous to want it both ways.
  If groups on the other side want to indict the process, then we can 
have a debate about the environmental review process in this country, 
but to change the rules in the middle of the game is not fair nor 
right, especially if it comes from one State to another State.
  The Federal permitting process is nearing completion, and I will 
respect the end result. I don't know what the result will be.
  As the Congressman for all Alaska, again, I am offended--all Members 
should be too--when another Congressman gets involved in my State or my 
district.
  That is wrong. This is the House of Representatives. It is not the 
House of the Federal Government.
  The House of Representatives speaks for their people, especially when 
it comes to States rights.
  The people of Alaska have a right to have this decided by the book 
and free from interference by parties outside the State that seek to 
impose their wills or philosophies on the State and the people.
  So, again, Madam Speaker, I want to remind my majority leaders: Let's 
stop this rat infestation. Let's keep this pure. Let's be about 
appropriations. Let's keep this in mind as we go through this process.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McNerney).
  Mr. McNERNEY. Madam Speaker, first I want to thank the chair and the 
ranking member for their hard work in considering all these amendments.
  Madam Speaker, my amendment would increase and decrease by $15 
million DOE's Energy Information Administration budget to stimulate 
more robust data collection and analysis from their commercial and 
residential surveys, specifically with regards to water consumption, as 
well as to make water consumption data for commercial buildings 
available to the public, broken down by principal building activity and 
by region.
  Our energy and water systems are interdependent.
  As water scarcity, availability, and uncertainty become more 
prominent, the U.S. energy system risks exposure to potential 
associated vulnerabilities.
  Therefore, it is time for a more integrated approach to address the 
challenges and opportunity of the energy-water nexus.
  My amendment aims to assist us in that process by encouraging the EIA 
to modify and improve their existing data collection and analysis 
programs, enabling us to better collect and utilize energy-water data.
  I urge adoption of this amendment.

                              {time}  1415

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin).
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, on this, the funeral day of the great 
John Lewis, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment to fund a 
critical source of knowledge for my State, ``The State of Black 
Michigan'' report. This amendment comes directly from my meetings with 
African-American leaders in my district in the wake of the killing of 
George Floyd.
  For four decades, researchers at Michigan State University compiled 
``The State of Black Michigan'' report. This critical research project 
was established in the wake of civil unrest in the 1960s, and until 
2007, it did what all good research does: it used hard data and facts, 
regardless of politics, to inform and hold elected leaders accountable 
for the persistent inequality in housing, healthcare, education, 
economic opportunity, and more.

[[Page H4164]]

  The work to produce ``The State of Black Michigan'' was spearheaded 
by Dr. Joe Darden at Michigan State. It was not easy or cheap, and 
since 2007, without a source of dedicated funding, we have been without 
the knowledge of this report.
  Madam Speaker, now, as the country once again confronts systemic 
racism and inequality, we must acknowledge and learn from the 
underlying facts to build effective policies. My amendment would 
provide a source of funding for efforts such as ``The State of Black 
Michigan'' so that we can confront systemic inequalities and actually 
do something about these systemic problems.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. Schrier).
  Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, researchers across the globe are working 
on vaccines to protect us from COVID-19, and once rigorous studies are 
complete, we will be able to roll this out to the public and provide 
protection from this dreadful disease.
  But we need to be doing work now to build public trust and vaccine 
safety and understand concerns within specific communities. In order to 
do that, we need data on vaccine confidence and access broken down by 
race, ethnicity, geography, and age.
  Just this week, we have seen a prominent example of bad actors who 
willfully undermine science, peddle conspiracy theories, and 
intentionally spread misinformation.
  This won't be the last time. It is going to be hard to counter 
sophisticated efforts to sow doubt in vaccine evidence, efficacy, and 
safety, and we must reckon with this country's legacy of unconscionable 
treatment of people of color.
  My amendment ensures that we will get reliable information to the 
American people because a safe and effective vaccine is only helpful if 
people are confident in it and willing to take it.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).
  Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the Member for yielding and 
including my two amendments in this package.
  My first amendment directs OSHA to implement an emergency temporary 
standard to protect employees, employers, and customers from COVID-19.
  In these chaotic times, standards will provide that predictability we 
need. Without these enforceable standards, we can't take that 
responsibility to reopen in a safe and effective way.
  My second amendment: Health and Human Services must create 
comprehensive national testing and tracing for childcare centers. 
Essential employees are hard at work. Millions want to get back to 
work. Yet, childcare providers can't do the job they need to do to be 
safe.
  A national testing strategy and contact tracing standard will help 
safely reopen these childcare centers. It is what our economy needs. It 
is what our kids need and, certainly, what our parents need.
  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments, and I thank the 
chairman, once again, for his years of service.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.)
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman 
for including my two amendments here regarding housing discrimination.
  Yesterday, the President had tweeted that he was ``happy to inform 
all of the people living their suburban lifestyle dream that you will 
no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low-income housing 
built in your neighborhood.''
  Now, this is classic, textbook discrimination. And we are here to 
rise to say: Uh-uh. This is not going to happen on our watch and that 
our Nation is strengthened and exemplified by diversity of class, race, 
and all backgrounds when it comes to housing; that HUD and the 
Department of Housing has an affirmative responsibility to not just 
prevent discrimination but to actively dismantle years and decades of 
actively racist and discriminatory policy.
  That is our responsibility, and we have a responsibility to block 
that discriminatory policy wherever we see it.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Correa).
  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am 
proud to support the Trahan-Correa amendment.
  Our most precious gifts that we have in life are our children. As 
parents, nothing is more important than the well-being of our children.
  Today, parents across the country are very concerned about their 
children's health, as they should be. Parents across this country are 
also concerned about their children's education and how to move 
forward.
  Parents and local school boards, elected by the local voters, are in 
the best position to make the decisions on when to open those schools, 
and under what circumstances, not Washington bureaucrats.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my friend, Ms. 
Ocasio-Cortez' leadership and partnership stopping the Trump 
administration's reckless attack on fair housing.
  For a century, housing discrimination against Black Americans and 
people of color was rampant. They were shut out of programs. It has 
been a struggle to be able to engage in fair housing practices.
  The Obama administration reversed this disparate treatment by 
strengthening the Fair Housing Act. But the current occupant of the 
White House has, instead, rescinded the rule with his thinly veiled 
racist tweet suggesting that individuals in suburbs will no longer have 
to be ``bothered or financially hurt by having low-income housing built 
in their neighborhoods.''
  This continues a pattern for over a century, one of the reasons that 
people of color have been denied housing opportunities and an escalator 
to the middle class.
  We ought to approve this amendment, push back, and recommit ourselves 
on the day that we lay our friend, John Lewis, to rest that we 
recognize his commitment to fair housing.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I ask for support of the amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McHENERY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the 
Pascrell/Kaptur amendment that would increase funding to the United 
States Postal Service to carry out a pilot program for postal banking.
  In 2018, President Donald Trump created a special task force to 
specifically review the Post Office and necessary reforms. The Treasury 
Department was directed to release the Task Force's recommendations, 
which it did in its report, ``United States Postal Service: A 
Sustainable Path Forward.''
  In its report, the Task Force was clear: ``given the USPS's narrow 
expertise and capital limitations, USPS should not pursue expanding 
into new sectors, such as postal banking, the USPS does not have a 
demonstrated competency or comparative advantage, or where balance 
sheet risk would be added.''
  The Post Office agreed. In response to a widely criticized and highly 
unusual report by the United States Postal Service Office of Inspector 
General (OIG), the Post Office made clear that despite any 
recommendations to the contrary from the OIG, the Post Office core 
mission ``is delivery, not banking.''
  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) agreed. In March, the GAO 
released a report finding that new, non-postal services like postal 
banking may have limited viability. Based on interviews the GAO 
conducted with the USPS officials, postmasters, postal employees, and 
consumer groups, GAO cautioned that postal banking may ``generate 
minimal revenue and [the] USPS may face factors limiting the viability 
of these offerings.''
  The Task Force said no. The Post Office said no. The GAO cautioned 
against it. Yet there are some in Congress who seemingly have put 
blinders on the overwhelming expertise of those who say this is a bad 
idea.
  The cost of this willful blindness is at the expense of community 
banks and small financial institutions. Since Dodd-Frank, community 
financial institutions have struggled with the regulatory burdens and 
compliance regimes that are now required to provide basic financial 
services to more Americans. Allowing the federal government to go into 
banking via the Post Office might well be more than these financial 
institutions can bear.

[[Page H4165]]

  In short, postal banking is a bad idea. And one that I have fought 
over the years and will continue to fight as needed going forward.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of 
En Bloc No. 5, to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science, 
Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General 
Government, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, 
Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act.
  I thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole for including 
several amendments in the rule for House consideration of H.R. 7617.
  The Jackson Lee amendments are in the following Divisions:
  Division A--Department of Defense;
  Division B--Commerce, Justice, Science;
  Division F--Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; and
  Division G--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.
  The Jackson Lee Amendments made in order for Division G provide 
funding for Fiscal Year 2021 Transportation, Housing and Urban 
Development and exemplify the House of Representatives' commitment to 
making real policy change and upholding Black Lives.
  Three Jackson Lee amendments to this Division are complementary 
because they protect the history and culture of Black Lives from our 
past into our present by protecting areas that are cited in Public Law 
116-111, which enacts H.R. 434, the National Emancipation Historic 
Trail Study Act.
  The Emancipation National Historic Trail Act would pave the way for 
the establishment of only the second nationally recognized historic 
trail that chronicles the experience of African Americans in their 
struggle for equality and justice.
  H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historical Trail Act, designates 
the 51 miles from the historic Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in 
Galveston, Texas, along Highway 3 and I-45, north to Freedmen's Town 
and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas as a national historic trail.
  The key amendments to Division G of H.R. 7617, are: Jackson Lee 
Amendments No. 320, No. 321, and No. 323, which are included in En Bloc 
No. 5.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 320, included in En Bloc No. 5, prohibits 
the Department of Transportation from using funds for Section 106 
Transportation construction projects in urban areas that have not been 
determined to meet the statutory and fiduciary obligations of the 
National Historic Preservation Act.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 322, included in En Bloc No. 5, provides 
$1,000,000 in assistance to address challenges faced by communities 
impacted by persistent poverty and are not included in decision making 
when major highway construction threatens their homes, businesses, and 
culturally significant structures.
  These two amendments make a statement in support of preserving the 
history of Black Lives, because this history matters.
  Through these lives, a nation was forged out of what should have 
taken hundreds of years for America to rival Europe in economic might, 
industrial capacity, and military strength, it took less than a hundred 
because of forced labor worked beyond human capacity, compassion, or 
decency under a system of chattel slavery, which was more cruel than 
any conceived form of forced involuntary labor prior to what was 
created in the United States.
  Some may ask, why do we need an H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and 
Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act, it is because 
we have not, as a nation nor as a people, gotten to the truth about 
what chattel slavery was, why those who created it thought it was 
necessary, and what steps were taken to poison every institution known 
to mankind to accept it as natural, normal and in many records as 
``compassionate''.
  Until we understand what was done, why it was done, and how it was 
achieved, there is no method to chart a course out of it, to get beyond 
its influence, to fully eradiate it from our minds, institutions, and 
way of life.
  One of the vestiges of slavery is how government entities treat 
African Americans' right to own property--a home is the single greatest 
source of wealth for black people living within the United States.
  Achieving homeownership is celebrated and the home becomes a source 
of stability for the family over multiple generations.
  Stable communities led to the establishment of places of worship, 
businesses, as well as social and cultural centers of life within 
residential areas.
  One of these historic communities is Independence Heights, which 
began in the 1900s, a time in which African Americans faced enormous 
difficulties securing property and establishing a place to live in the 
South.
  Having faith in the message of self-determination advocated by Booker 
T. Washington, the early pioneers of Independence Heights secured 
property from the Wright Land Company, set up their own system of 
governance, and became the first town incorporated by African Americans 
in Texas in 1915.
  Annexed by the City of Houston in 1929, Independence Heights remains 
a community that reflects and cherishes its values, accomplishments, 
and history to this day.
  This area and others cited in Public Law 116-111 are under threat 
from the Texas Department of Transportation starting after World War 
II, when major highway construction was invoked nationally, and has 
continued to the present day.
  For more than 14 years, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) 
has been planning the North Houston Highway Improvement Project 
(NHHIP), a massive expansion of Interstate 45 that will completely 
reshape freeway transit around downtown Houston, with major changes to 
I-45, I-69, I-10 and Hwy 288 over the next decade.
  These changes will threaten the Near Northside of Houston, taking way 
the Leonel Castillo Community Center and Greater New Hope Missionary 
Baptist Church along with seven other historic churches in Independence 
Heights.
  The proposed expansion of I-45 north of downtown to Beltway 8 will 
result in impacts to neighborhoods along either side of I-45 North, as 
hundreds of residents face displacement.
  Located just northwest of the intersection of I-610 and I-45, the 
historic neighborhood of Independence Heights is one of those 
neighborhoods facing said impacts.
  Unfortunately, in 2019 when TxDOT made public its report on the 
Project's expected impacts to historical resources required under the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the agency completely left 
Independence Heights out of its survey.
  Independence Heights is listed in the National Register of Historic 
Places as the first state chartered community of former slaves and is a 
destination site on state historic heritage trails such as the Texas 
Independence Trail and holds the distinction as the first town 
incorporated by African Americans in the state of Texas.
  After World War II, the construction of the I-45 and 610 Loop 
isolated Independence Heights from the rest of the city of Houston.
  Starting after World War II, the push to build highways accelerated 
and the brunt of the pain for this growth was felt by black and brown 
communities not just in Texas but everywhere massive projects were 
undertaken.
  Once again, I-45 has planned major reconstruction that could impact 
communities of color, including historic black neighborhoods like 
Independence Heights and the Fifth Ward, as plans call for demolishing 
homes and businesses to accommodate more roadway space.
  TxDoT has not been kind to Independence Heights or other communities 
around the network of freeways and interchanges in the downtown area.
  Over the decades, these same areas have lost hundreds of homes, 
businesses and historic places to massive rebuilds and new construction 
has taken hundreds of homes and historic sites from Independence 
Heights.
  TxDOT's plans for the I-45 massive rebuild seem to have relied on 
previous policies of the past I-610 freeway construction for the 
current plan to take neighborhood property.
  Today, the world has changed--and the faith of historic places and 
the community that cherishes them can take comfort in knowing that H.R. 
434, the ``Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act,'' became 
Public Law 116-111 on January 27, 2020.
  The ambition of taking on the effort of building a national historic 
trial was made possible by the dedication and hard work of local 
historic preservationists who tell the story of the African American 
experience.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 323, included in En Bloc No. 5, increases 
by $1,000,000 the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to 
address the fairness in the use of Community Development Block Grant 
Disaster funding to repair or replace single family homes damaged 
during Hurricane Harvey to ensure that multigenerational homes can 
house the family at documented predisaster capacity.
  This amendment addresses the unfair action taken to diminish the 
quality of repairs or replacement of homes damaged by Hurricane Harvey.
  The law providing the final supplement for disaster recovery for 
Hurricanes Harvey and Maria disaster housing recovery provisions of the 
bill allowed local jurisdictions to be in control over recovery or 
repair of single and multi-family housing.
  The City of Houston applied for and was awarded the grant to replace 
or repair single and multi-family housing for city residents.
  The state of Texas General Land Office is attempting to take back the 
grant and replace the city's plan to repair or replace housing with a 
plan to only repair two bedrooms no matter how many the home had at the 
time of the storm's damage.
  The City of Houston strongly opposes the Texas General Land Office's 
(``GLO'') proposal

[[Page H4166]]

to eliminate all City-administered CDBG-DR 17 program funding for 
several reasons.
  First, the City's programs are successful and on schedule. For 
example, even though the City is only 1.5 years into its grant: $446 
million (35 percent) of total funds allocated to the City has already 
been designated for the specific properties or projects at which the 
assistance is to be used. $153 million (12 percent) is already under a 
signed contract that obligates its use to deliver recovery services, 
with more contracts being signed on a weekly basis.
  The City's Single-Family programs have already fully served 234 
homeowners, with another 246 families submitted to or approved by GLO 
and currently being served.
  At the current pace, the City will serve 1000 families for each of 
the next 4 years before the end of the contract, for an estimated total 
served of 4,480 families.
  Second, the City's programs are better and more appropriate for the 
citizens of the City than those the GLO has implemented.
  As intended by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(``HUD''), the City's programs are serving the most vulnerable families 
first.
  This prioritization addresses systemic racial inequalities that have 
regularly occurred in prior disaster recovery efforts, including the 
disaster recovery programs previously overseen by the State.
  Specifically, the City has adjusted its approach to ensure Houston's 
most vulnerable residents are not left behind because of regulatory or 
bureaucratic barriers erected by the State or any other entity.
  This number does not include contracts for third-party vendors.
  The City's multifamily program will create units that are affordable 
for more than twice as long the State's program, will serve far more 
very low income families than the State's program, and is attracting 
seven times the amount of funding leverage (a requirement of the CDBG-
DR 17 program) as compared to the State's program.
  The City's program provides more recovery choices to Hurricane 
Harvey-impacted renters allowing them to use recovery funds to become 
homeowners. The State's program does not provide this option.
  The third reason the city of Houston is opposing the GLO's proposed 
amendment to the grant award is because it violates the terms of its 
subrecipient agreement, GLO Contract No. 19-147-001-B489, as amended, 
with the City (the ``Contract'').
  Section 2.03 of the Contract provides that amendments to increase or 
decrease the amount of the subaward must be made by written agreement 
of the parties and the City has not consented to any reduction in its 
subaward.
  Funding under the Contract has not been reduced or terminated.
  The City is performing under the terms of the Contract and has not 
defaulted under the Contract.
  Finally, the GLO has demonstrated that it has a difficult time 
complying with HUD requirements and with establishing and communicating 
its own bureaucratic and confusing requirements to the City.
  Two years ago, as it was drafting its own plan for the $5 billion 
recovery funds, the GLO failed to provide appropriate community 
engagement in Houston and Harris County, jurisdictions representing 
half of the state's total residential damage from Harvey.
  Due to the above failure, HUD directed the State to allow the City to 
submit its own action plan, directed by and informed by Houstonians. As 
directed by HUD and agreed to by the State, the GLO's only role as the 
passthrough entity for the funding was to ensure compliance with HUD 
regulations.
  The State has failed in this role, by making up requirements for the 
City's programs completely unrelated to any set by HUD but especially 
in its review of the City's home repair program.
  Having decided to impose far more requirements than originally agreed 
to by the City or required by HUD, the GLO failed to communicate these 
additional requirements at the beginning of the program--using instead 
its Requests for Information (``RFIs'') process to reject files and 
repeatedly changing its process along the way in order to continue 
rejecting files submitted by the City.
  For these reasons, and to protect the homes of hundreds of Black 
Homeowners, it matters that the city, so long as it meets or exceeds 
the expectations for recovery of homes post Hurricane Harvey, they 
should be allowed to continue the work.
  I urge all my colleagues to vote in support of En Bloc No. 5 and the 
Jackson Lee Amendments.
                                                  City of Houston,
                                    Houston, Texas, July 28, 2020.
     Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: On behalf of the City of 
     Houston, I am writing to express strong support of your 
     amendment #38 House Resolution 7617 regarding common-sense 
     approach to providing disaster recovery assistance to 
     households with homes damaged by Hurricane Harvey.
       In Houston, many of our lower-income seniors live in single 
     family homes that are their only asset. Of course, homeowners 
     who have lived in homes with more than two bedrooms for many 
     years would want to retain the value of that precious asset, 
     even as they may need significant federal help to reconstruct 
     their homes. Our desired standard is to rebuild a three-
     bedroom home for households of four of fewer people for 
     people whose homes had three of more bedrooms before the 
     storm.
       While this is the standard outline in City of Houston 
     guidelines, we are subject to rules set by the Texas General 
     Land Office (GLO). GLO requires that occupancy as the sole 
     factor for determining the size of rebuilt homes. Under GLO 
     rules, people who have lived for many years in a three- or 
     four-bedroom home would be forced to accept a two-bedroom 
     home as a condition of receiving Harvey assistance.
       This policy will have the unintended effect of depressing 
     property values across those neighborhoods, while this 
     amendment will help address that disparity and is consistent 
     with the feedback from Houstonians.
       We must work together to ensure that Houston has a health 
     housing stock of the future, and that vulnerable Houstonians 
     who receive much-needed recovery funds after Harvey are not 
     forced to unreasonable downsize longstanding family homes as 
     a condition of receiving assistance.
           Sincerely,
                                                 Sylvester Turner,
     Mayor.
                                  ____

                                                  City of Houston,
                                    Houston, Texas, July 28, 2020.
     Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: The City of Houston 
     (``City'') strongly opposes the Texas General Land Office's 
     (``GLO'') preposterous proposal to eliminate all City-
     administered CDBG-DR 17 program funding for several reasons. 
     First, the City's programs are successful and on schedule. 
     For example, even though the City is only 1.5 years into its 
     grant:
       $446 million (35%) of total funds allocated to the City has 
     already been designated for the specific properties or 
     projects at which the assistance is to be used.
       $153 million (12%) is already under a signed contract that 
     obligates its use to deliver recovery services, with more 
     contracts being signed on a weekly basis.
       The City's Single-Family programs have already fully served 
     234 homeowners, with another 246 families submitted to or 
     approved by GLO and currently being served. At the current 
     pace, the City will serve 1000 families for each of the next 
     4 years before the end of the contract, for an estimated 
     total served of 4,480 families.
       Second, the City's programs are better and more appropriate 
     for the citizens of the City than those the GLO has 
     implemented.
       As intended by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
     Development (``HUD''), the City's programs are serving the 
     most vulnerable families first. This prioritization addresses 
     systemic racial inequalities that have regularly occurred in 
     prior disaster recovery efforts, including the disaster 
     recovery programs previously overseen by the State. 
     Specifically, the City has adjusted its approach to ensure 
     Houston's most vulnerable residents are not left behind 
     because of regulatory or bureaucratic barriers erected by the 
     State or any other entity.
       The City's multifamily program will create units that are 
     affordable for more than twice as long the State's program, 
     will serve far more very low income families than the State's 
     program, and is attracting 7 times the amount of funding 
     leverage (a requirement of the CDBG-DR 17 program) as 
     compared to the State's program.
       The City's program provides more recovery choices to 
     Hurricane Harvey-impacted renters allowing them to use 
     recovery funds to become homeowners. The State's program does 
     not provide this option.
       Third, the GLO's proposed amendment violates the terms of 
     its subrecipient agreement, GLO Contract No. 19-147-001-B489, 
     as amended, with the City (the ``Contract'').
       Section 2.03 of the Contract provides that amendments to 
     increase or decrease the amount of the subaward must be made 
     by written agreement of the parties and the City has not 
     consented to any reduction in its subaward.
       Funding under the Contract has not been reduced or 
     terminated.
       The City is performing under the terms of the Contract and 
     has not defaulted under the Contract.
       Finally, the GLO has demonstrated that it has a difficult 
     time complying with HUD requirements and with establishing 
     and communicating its own bureaucratic and confusing 
     requirements to the City.
       Two years ago, as it was drafting its own plan for the $5 
     billion recovery funds, the GLO failed to provide appropriate 
     community engagement in Houston and Harris County, 
     jurisdictions representing half of the state's total 
     residential damage from Harvey.
       Due to the above failure, HUD directed the State to allow 
     the City to submit its own action plan, directed by and 
     informed by

[[Page H4167]]

     Houstonians. As directed by HUD and agreed to by the State, 
     the GLO's only role as the passthrough entity for the funding 
     was to ensure compliance with HUD regulations. The State has 
     failed in this role, by making up requirements for the City's 
     programs completely unrelated to any set by HUD but 
     especially in its review of the City's home repair program.
       Having decided to impose far more requirements than 
     originally agreed to by the City or required by HUD, the GLO 
     failed to communicate these additional requirements at the 
     beginning of the program--using instead its Requests for 
     Information (``RFIs'') process to reject files and repeatedly 
     changing its process along the way in order to continue 
     rejecting files submitted by the City.
       1. The City's programs are successful and on schedule by 
     any measure and there is no reasonable rationale for taking 
     away City administration of the programs. Such an action only 
     creates delays and harms the citizens of Houston.


                    Community Engagement & Outreach

       The City's Hurricane Harvey recovery programs were designed 
     with significant community consultation, reaching nearly 
     4,500 citizens. In response to the destruction that Hurricane 
     Harvey caused, Congress allocated $5.024 billion to the State 
     of Texas in September 2017. In March 2018, the State of Texas 
     announced that the City would have local control over $1.15 
     billion of these funds. When the State of Texas released its 
     State Action Plan in April 2018, the City had a short window 
     of time in which to develop an Action Plan for its portion of 
     the allocated funds. To increase transparency in the process 
     and support community efforts that promote the ``right to 
     stay, right to choose'' framework promoted by housing 
     advocates locally, the City's Housing and Community 
     Development Department (``HCDD'') initiated its largest 
     community engagement effort to date. Partners, organizations, 
     and consulting teams, including building community WORKSHOP 
     ([be]) and the Community Design Resource Center, were engaged 
     to increase the success and reach of the engagement process.
       What the City heard from Houstonians is summarized as 
     follows: Neighborhoods want a voice in the process of 
     prioritizing where the money goes. Housing advocates want to 
     ensure that Houston's low- to moderate-income residents are 
     prioritized in this recovery effort. Past recovery efforts 
     led by the State fell short and heighten the desire by 
     Houstonians for transparency and community participation in 
     the disaster recovery decision making process. Housing and 
     neighborhood advocates affirm the right of residents to have 
     a say in what happens in their neighborhoods. A partnership 
     approach between the City and community groups is the 
     appropriate model to pursue.


                          Multifamily Program

       The multifamily program that resulted from the City's 
     community consultation was designed to specifically address 
     community concerns and needs, including flooding concerns, 
     fair housing considerations, and replacement of affordable 
     rental units lost in the storm. The City's multifamily 
     program provides loans to local multifamily developments that 
     agree to reserve a certain number of units for families at or 
     above the poverty level for many decades. CDBG-DR multifamily 
     funding can be used to rehabilitate or build new, affordable 
     apartment buildings. While the City's programs respond to 
     basic HUD requirements for targeting the majority of 
     assistance to low-income families, the City's programs go 
     much further to fully address the unmet needs in Houston. The 
     City's multifamily programs are a model for how to spend and 
     leverage federal funds to maximize their benefit to low-
     income Houstonians. Specifically, the City's multifamily 
     program achieves the following: More resilient design to 
     ensure these homes are not flooded in the next storm; 
     Equitable placement throughout the City to affirmatively 
     further fair housing; Long-term affordability through a 
     mandatory minimum affordability period of 40 years of 
     affordability; Reserving a significant number of units for 
     occupancy by extremely low-income and very low-income 
     families; Leveraging CDBG-DR resources to augment the Federal 
     dollars and attract tax credits, bank loans and philanthropic 
     funds; and Expanding workforce protections to ensure those 
     building the homes have a livable wage, a safe work 
     environment and a career path.
       The program includes requirements to ensure that 
     developments constructed with City dollars are built to 
     withstand future storm damage. As part of its resiliency 
     planning, during Round2 of the City's multifamily application 
     process, the City instituted additional design standards to 
     ensure that the new developments would withstand future 
     flooding. These standards provide guidance for multifamily 
     building owners on a variety of retrofit strategies and 
     outline mitigation strategies against a variety of hazards. 
     Applicants were required to provide the City preconstruction, 
     design phase information showing the planned project will 
     incorporate resilient building measures to protect residents 
     from future disasters. For new construction or major 
     rehabilitation projects, this requires identification of a 
     minimum of 12 resilient project points. Resilient Areas where 
     developments were graded are based on the Enterprise Ready to 
     Respond: Strategies for Multifamily Building Resilience in 
     the areas of protection, adaptation, back up measures and 
     community as follows:
       Protection--Applicants are required to design a minimum of 
     two distinct strategies to reduce a building's vulnerability 
     to extreme weather.
       Adaptation--Applicants are required to design a minimum of 
     three distinct strategies that improve a facility's ability 
     to adapt to changing climate conditions
       Back up measures--Applicants are required to design at 
     least one strategy that provide critical needs when a 
     facility loses power or other services.
       Community--Applicants incorporate two strategies that 
     encourage behavior which enhances resilience
       Green Building Standard--Applicants are required to build 
     their development to one of four energy efficiency standards 
     (HUD requirement)
       Solar--Applicants are required to design buildings to be 
     solar ready (HUD requirement)
       Electric Vehicles (``EV'')--Applicants are required to 
     incorporate standards to be ready to implement EV charging 
     stations
       Substantial amendments are to be reviewed by HUD for 
     clarity. As shown above, Action Plan Amendment 7 is simply 
     not clear. It is confusing and misleading, especially with 
     regard to programs operated within the City.


Action Plan Amendment 7 does not adequately address fair housing needs 
                              in the City

       We are further concerned that the GLO's efforts to replace 
     the City's CDBG-DR 17 programs with GLO's more limited 
     programs will expose the GLO, and potentially the City, to 
     potential fair housing claims. The City's programs were 
     specifically designed to address affirmatively furthering 
     fair housing objectives and nondiscrimination in the City. 
     The City prioritized our assistance in the single family 
     programs for our most vulnerable and impacted citizens, which 
     are often protected classes (including people of color and 
     persons with disabilities). The City prioritized the new 
     rental units created in the multifamily program in 
     neighborhoods of opportunity, ensured that more units are 
     available long-term to very low income families, and we have 
     maximized our investment of federal resources through 
     requiring developers to obtain significant leverage of other 
     private and public dollars. Both GLO and HUD are currently 
     being sued for fair housing violations by renters and low-
     income families who believed GLO's allocation of funds and 
     program design discriminates against renters (who in Texas 
     are also disproportionately protected classes) and does not 
     properly take into account the needs of Texans impacted by 
     Hurricane Harvey. We would think that, rather than apply 
     programs that are already under fire for fair housing 
     violations in Houston, the GLO would welcome the continued 
     operation of programs that better address the fair housing 
     needs of the citizens of the City and are not the subject of 
     active fair housing litigation.


                               conclusion

       These comments highlight the numerous flaws in Action Plan 
     Amendment 7. It is not approvable by HUD and requires 
     substantial revision. While the City urges the GLO to cease 
     its unreasonable efforts and revise the Action Plan Amendment 
     7 to allow the City to continue to administer its programs 
     and help the citizens of Houston, we note separately that any 
     substantive revision to this Amendment should be subject to 
     further public comment. The GLO should draft a sensible, 
     approvable Amendment 7 and re-issue for the required public 
     comment.
       In the alternative, GLO should not submit Action Plan 
     Amendment 7 as drafted to HUD. If GLO chooses to do so, HUD 
     should reject the portions of the amendment that eliminate 
     the City's administration of its allocation of CDBG-DR 17 
     funds so as to enable the citizens of Houston to access much-
     needed funds and services. HUD should reject the amendment on 
     the ground that it is incomplete and does not fully respond 
     to the applicable criteria governing the CBGD-DR program. In 
     the alternative, HUD should modify the grant such that it 
     becomes a direct grant to the City, rather than one 
     administered by the State.

       Dear Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole: We write to 
     express our overwhelming support for Congresswoman Sheila 
     Jackson Lee's Amendment #30 to Div. C of H.R. 7608. Div. C of 
     H.R. 7608 will provide Fiscal Year 2021 funding to the 
     Department of Interior, and the National Parks Service 
     (''NPS'') which manages our nation's parks, monuments, and 
     federally recognized historic trails.
       As you are aware, Amendment #30 proposes that $6 million of 
     the funds allocated to the NPS should be used to address the 
     backlog of

[[Page H4168]]

     national historic trail studies authorized by law, with 
     special attention to enacted trail studies, relating to the 
     history of underrepresented groups. Amendment #30 is of 
     particular importance to us as it relates to H.R. 434--
     Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act and the 
     Emancipation National Historic Trail (the ``Emancipation 
     National Historic Trail'')--a 51-mile route showing the 
     migration of newly freed slaves and other people of African 
     descent in the 19th century. The Emancipation National 
     Historic Trail begins at the location of the famous June 19, 
     1865, Juneteenth Announcement, commemorating the ending of 
     slavery in Texas, and follows the route of the newly freed 
     and formerly enslaved persons into Houston, Texas, and ends 
     in Emancipation Park and the historic Independence Heights. 
     The Emancipation National Historic Trail will become only the 
     second trail in the 243-year history of the United States to 
     commemorate the history of African Americans. Currently, the 
     National Parks Service has only one other National Historic 
     Trail which centers on the African American experience. It is 
     the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, which covers 
     a 54-mile path between Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, and 
     which was named a national historic trail in 1996. The Selma 
     to Montgomery trail tells an important story about a pivotal 
     moment in the nation's struggle transitioning from a history 
     of segregation towards the modem Civil Rights Movement.
       The goals of the Emancipation National Historic Trail are 
     the restoration, resurrection, and ascension of historical 
     memory. It is a remarkable story and one that all Americans 
     can be proud to share with the world. However, this cannot 
     occur without direct financial support as offered by 
     Amendment #30 to Div. C of H.R. 7608. Indeed, Amendment #30 
     would preserve critical periods of U.S. history not otherwise 
     represented in existing Federal trails or historic places.
       Amendment #30 provides support for the commencement of the 
     Emancipation National Historic Trail study and will support 
     additional studies that have been approved by Congress and 
     signed into law. Your support and championing of 
     Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee's Amendment #30 is 
     appreciated as it will provide vital resources for this 
     historic endeavor.

     to promote collaborations between Historically Black College 
     and Universities (``HBCUs'') and local historic societies to 
     identify, restore, and preserve places of historic 
     significance to African Americans that are at risk of being 
     lost. Amendment #78 is of particular importance to us as it

     on projects such as the Emancipation National Historic Trail 
     and other projects to reclaim treasures that would otherwise 
     be lost for future generations, and would train young people 
     in some of the vital fields that are needed to support the 
     protection of historic treasures in underserved communities.
       We ask that you support Congresswoman Jackson Lee's 
     Amendment #78 to Div. C of H.R. 7608 because it is needed and 
     would contribute to the important work of saving historic

     of the community of Independence Heights we are sending this 
     letter to show our support for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson

     been determined to meet the statutory and fiduciary

     community is one of the identified places on the National 
     Emancipation Historic Trail, we are facing extreme pressure 
     from gentrification and impending displacement and cultural 
     erasure as a result of the North Houston Highway Improvement 
     Project. More specifically, we are faced with the loss of 
     many key historic structures in our community that will 
     contribute to our placement on the historic trail. Supporting 
     this amendment is key for our community as it will help 
     protect the remaining historical and culturally significant 
     structures

previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc.
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


                 Amendment No. 219 Offered by Mr. Allen

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
219 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of division F (before the short title), insert 
     the following:
       Sec. __.  The total amount of appropriations made available 
     by this Act is hereby reduced by 5 percent.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, last week, I stood before this body as we 
voted on the first spending package, which, like this package, was 
enormous and brought before this House without enough time to learn 
where the American people's tax dollars are actually going.
  Today, we are considering 6 of the 12 traditional appropriation bills 
in one package.
  We must get back to regular order and a process where we can 
carefully consider and examine each bill and one that works for the 
American people. The bills in this package would spend $1.3 trillion in 
total discretionary spending, a 13.9 percent increase from the budget 
that was agreed to.
  I would once again like to state for the record that the Democratic 
majority can't even stick to the bipartisan budget that was agreed to 
last year.
  The first appropriations package that was passed last week contains 
$37 billion in emergency measures, and this package adds another $207 
billion of such spending. With that addition, according to the 
Congressional Budget

[[Page H4170]]

Office estimate, this level of spending is 23.5 percent higher than the 
President's request.
  No business or family in this country would ever dream of spending 
money like this that they don't have and have no idea where they are 
going to get it. So why does this body think we are an exception?
  Unfortunately, that is business as usual for the 116th Congress.
  My amendment today is simple. It would reduce the total amount of 
funding for the Labor, HHS, and Education division by 5 percent for 
fiscal year 2021.
  HHS alone is a $1.2 trillion agency. It employs hundreds of lawyers. 
Without my amendment, the division provides a net total of $222.4 
billion in fiscal year 2021 discretionary budget authority.
  If you do the math, my amendment would cut about $9.8 billion. I urge 
my Democratic colleagues to support my amendment since they will still 
be overspending, but just a little bit less than they initially 
intended.
  I just want to note that I wanted to offer a 5 percent cut to 
multiple divisions throughout this bill, but continuing the Democrats' 
shadowy process, only this one amendment to this bill was ruled in 
order.
  We can no longer neglect our national debt crisis, which is at 
unsustainable heights. It is morally wrong to burden our children and 
grandchildren with excessive debt because we can't seem to get our act 
together and exercise fiscal constraint.
  Let me explain myself like this: How in the world can we create a 
standard of healthcare and a standard of living in this country on the 
backs of our children and grandchildren? We can't pay for it. So what 
do we do? We send it to our children and grandchildren and I don't know 
how many generations.
  I urge my colleagues in this body to support my amendment today, and 
let's start having a serious discussion about how we can once again 
unleash economic growth in this country by restraining spending.
  I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1430

  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Connecticut is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I would just say to the gentleman, I hope 
he had the same concern about what happens to our children and 
grandchildren as he may have supported the unbelievable--what is it?--
$2 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in 
this Nation.
  Again, I rise in opposition to the amendment. It would cut funding 
for important programs and services that provide for working families 
in this country. Many of these programs are already underfunded; they 
fail to meet the existing need.
  For instance, the amendment would cut Head Start by $538 million, 
leading to thousands of children losing access to high-quality early 
learning programs, and that would be on the backs of today where we 
don't have an administration that wants to do anything about the loss 
of childcare in this country. They would cut the Childcare and 
Development Block Grant by almost $300 million at a time when childcare 
is in crisis. More than half of childcare programs could close if we do 
not provide emergency funding.
  Just yesterday, this House passed two emergency bills to bring much-
needed relief to childcare providers, and yet this amendment would cut 
funding for childcare.
  It would cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, a 
bipartisan priority, by $188 million.
  How about senior nutrition, which it would cut, including Meals on 
Wheels, by almost $50 million, resulting in 10 million fewer home-
delivered or prepackaged meals for low-income seniors.
  Think about it. Think about that.
  It would cut biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health 
by $2.3 billion, resulting in a reduction of nearly 2,500 new research 
grants.
  It would cut title 1 funding for our public schools by $828 million, 
reducing needed resources for 25 million low-income students.
  It would cut special education grants to States by $648 million. That 
would reduce support to provide services for 7.4 million students with 
disabilities, curtailing their ability to succeed.
  It would cut Federal financial aid programs, Pell grants, the SEOG 
program, and the Work-Study Program by $1.2 billion for students and 
for families in need.
  It would cut funding for job training programs by $185 million, 
resulting in fewer supports for Americans who are seeking better 
opportunities for themselves and for their families.
  It would cut funding by $122 million meant to help States manage and 
administer unemployment insurance claims and benefits for struggling 
Americans.
  Today, people are not even sure if their unemployment benefits are 
going to be cut off tomorrow unless the Senate would move and pass the 
HEROES bill, where we extend unemployment benefits. But, no, this 
amendment would cut $122 million, again, cutting the unemployment 
insurance program.
  This is about values. Budgets are about values, and $135 billion that 
is in the CARES bill has gone to or was prepared to go to 43,000 
taxpayers at $1.6 million as a tax rebate going back to 2018, 2019 when 
no one had even heard of the coronavirus. But that is okay. That is 
okay. We can pass that. We can do something about that because of whom 
it benefits.
  Think about whom we need to benefit in this institution and what our 
responsibilities are. Our responsibilities are to the working families 
and the essential workers today who are on the front lines trying to 
just be able to get by and also to save themselves, their health, and 
their families.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, in response, I understand that we are in 
unprecedented times, but H.R. 7617 moves our Nation in the wrong 
direction.
  We talk about values. Those same children who are in Head Start 
programs 20 years from now are going to be trying to find a job. Five 
months ago, we had the best economy in the world. We had more jobs than 
we had people looking for jobs.
  Isn't that what America is all about: living the American Dream?
  Yet what we are doing is those same children--and we say we care 
about the children--where are you going to get the money? Where are you 
going to get it? Off their backs?
  Madam Speaker, we can't continue this, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. Allen).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


              Amendment No. 239 Offered by Ms. Finkenauer

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
239 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       Page 749, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert 
     ``(increased by $12,000,000)''.
       Page 780, line 11, after the first dollar amount, insert 
     ``(reduced by $12,000,000)''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Iowa.
  Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise to offer this amendment to 
double Federal research funding for endometriosis over the level for 
fiscal year 2019.
  Endometriosis is a painful, chronic condition affecting 1 in 10 
women, 7 million women in the United States, with serious costs to 
their physical and emotional health and quality of life. Despite the 
prevalence of this disease

[[Page H4171]]

and the many women who have it, it remains misunderstood, 
underresearched and underfunded.
  Women and their caregivers, alike, often suffer from a lack of 
awareness about the symptoms of endometriosis and the disease itself.
  This is a profound and heavy moment for me right now because of the 
fact that, back in March, I came down to this Chamber and shared 
publicly for the very first time that I, too, suffer from 
endometriosis. You see, Madam Speaker, at the time when I gave my 
speech, I wanted to make sure that folks knew that I could still do my 
job, that, yes, I have this painful condition, but that I was tough and 
I could still do my job and my work.
  Luckily, I have been able to do that. I have my entire career. But 
what I realized since sharing my story is that I am absolutely one of 
the lucky ones, because this condition affects people in all different 
ways and in all different severities.
  I happened to have been fortunate to find out at a young age when my 
mother believed my pain. This is for the women whom I have heard from 
who have reached out and who have suffered in silence, the ones whose 
bodies this condition has attacked in even more severe ways, who have 
had to drop out of the workforce because of the severity of their 
condition, the ones who have lost decades of their lives and their 
future family plans in pain because there weren't better options and 
there weren't any answers. They are warriors, they are tough, and they 
are braver than we deserve.
  Today, we uplift those voices along with the truth that we must do 
more. You see, Madam Speaker, it is imperative that, with this funding, 
not only do we raise awareness of this issue, but we fight for better 
options: more than just one or two pills that don't necessarily work 
for every woman; more than extreme surgeries like cauterization or 
hysterectomies; and education and work to bring equity to other 
surgeries that are more advanced but yet specialized and available to 
so few because of the cost so that more women can get the care that 
they need and, quite frankly, deserve.
  At the same time, we need to also figure out why this condition 
happens in the first place. Does it start at birth? Does it happen 
later in life? Can it happen starting in adolescence?
  There are so many unknowns in this condition that we have known about 
since the 1920s. Again, 7 million women have it currently in the United 
States.
  Today, we push forward. Today, we celebrate a win. But today is just 
the beginning. We will continue to uplift and increase awareness, 
funding, and research every single step of the way.
  It has been an honor to hear the stories of the women who have 
reached out. They have told me, after reaching out and hearing their 
story, their pain described for the first time ever on the House floor, 
that they felt for the first time that they were not alone. After 
hearing their stories, they have made me feel not alone, and we will 
continue together. We have so much work left to do, and they are the 
reason we will not stop fighting.
  I fully urge the adoption of this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 30 seconds remaining.
  Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman for her 
passion, her concern, her courage, and her leadership on this issue.
  There really isn't much more to say. I thank her for standing up for 
women and for health.
  I am a survivor of ovarian cancer. The gentlewoman is tough. She is a 
warrior. She represents those who are suffering in pain every single 
day, when nearly 1 in 10 women are affected by this condition.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and 
support women's health research. It is imperative that women are able 
to survive endometriosis.
  Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


                Amendment No. 241 Offered by Mr. Foster

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
241 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       Strike section 510 of division F.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.
  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, this bipartisan amendment offered by Mr. 
Kelly and me and supported, also, by Mr. Schweikert and Dr. Bera, would 
strike section 510, which bans HHS from adopting standards for a unique 
patient identifier that would allow patients to be identified uniquely 
across electronic health record systems.
  In the 21 years that this misguided policy has been in place, tens of 
thousands of Americans have died due to getting the wrong drug to the 
wrong patient or due to incorrect or incomplete electronic medical 
records, all arising from the inability to simply and correctly merge 
health records from different systems.
  Matching records properly requires a unique identifier for each 
patient. A Federal ban on doing this properly makes our healthcare 
system more expensive and less safe for patients.
  A Johns Hopkins study recently calculated that more than 250,000 
deaths per year are due to medical errors, and patient 
misidentification is a significant contributor to this.

                              {time}  1445

  This ban is also handcuffing us in our fight against opioids. A 2018 
roundtable on the opioid crisis, cohosted by HHS and the nonprofit 
Center for Open Data Enterprise, recommended the generation of a unique 
identifier for each patient.
  This would not only guard against so-called ``doctor shopping'' for 
opioids by those struggling with substance use disorder, but could also 
prevent those in recovery from accidentally being given prescription 
opioids after an injury, surgery, or childbirth, thereby triggering a 
relapse.
  Finally, the ability to identify patients across the care continuum 
is also critical in our efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Accurate identification of patients is one of the most difficult and 
crucial operational issues during a public health emergency. Field 
hospitals and temporary testing sites in parks, convention centers, and 
parking lots only intensify these challenges.
  Laboratories that are testing patient specimens for COVID-19 are 
reporting that patient misidentification is causing COVID-19 test 
results to be returned to the wrong patient with potentially deadly 
consequences.
  Madam Speaker, repealing this ban tackles a known and fixable problem 
in our healthcare system. I urge support for this bipartisan amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition, 
although I am not opposed to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. It is nice working with the gentleman. This has been a couple 
of years in the making, and it is way over time.
  First, let's understand one thing: name and date of birth just isn't 
cutting it anymore, so this ban on HHS promulgating a unique patient 
identifier has resulted in a lot of American lives lost.
  Madam Speaker, Mr. Foster already referenced a Johns Hopkins study 
that said up to 250,000 deaths per year--and I want you to think about 
that number--250,000 deaths per year are due to medical error. When we 
are talking today about the number of deaths from the coronavirus, and 
saying now it has

[[Page H4172]]

gone over 145,000, these are deaths caused by a virus. And then here, 
we have another opportunity, if we are using the right data, we could 
possibly wipe out medical errors just by having access to that data and 
being able to cross-reference. Mr. Foster also referenced about opiates 
that sometimes patients are prescribed as a way to handle the pain.
  Madam Speaker, I sat in the emergency room with one of my children. 
And a doctor said to him: We found out what you have; you do have MRSA. 
It is on your hip, and we are going to have to operate on you, and we 
are going to have to be able to try and scrape that off. Although it 
won't be gone forever, it will take care of the problem right now. This 
is what I am going to do. And he went through the procedure.
  He also talked about the anesthesia that he was going to use. And he 
said to him: Do you have any problem with anything I have told you?
  And my son said: No, none at all.
  Well, luckily, I was sitting there. I said: Well, Doctor, the fact 
that he is a heroin addict, would that have any effect?
  The doctor looked up and said: Oh, my God. Thank God you said 
something about it, because that would absolutely be fatal for him.
  Madam Speaker, it is not just happening in studies. We are seeing it 
on the floor all the time in our hospitals. We are seeing that somehow 
data that is available is not being made available because of some 
archaic ban. Somebody says: No, we shouldn't have access because it 
just doesn't make sense.
  It does make sense. It makes all the sense in the world.
  In the year 2020, and what we are looking at right now, and we are 
talking about finding a cure for the coronavirus and doing it in a safe 
and smart way, why wouldn't we be able to look at all the data that is 
available? Why wouldn't we be able to cross-reference it? Why would we 
sit in the dark and say, this is my best guess? It doesn't have to be 
that way.
  Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster). This 
has been over 2 years trying to get this, and I feel very certain we 
will get it done, but this just makes sense.
  Quite frankly, the stuff we have been using for the last several 
decades it just--maybe back in 1999, when it was an issue for somebody, 
it made sense. Not today; not in 2020; not in the world we live in; not 
in the danger that we are putting people in just because we don't 
always have the right data in front of us. And we can do that. We have 
the ability to do that.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), chairwoman of the Appropriations, Labor-HHS 
and Education Subcommittee.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Congressman Foster's amendment, 
and was fascinated listening to the bipartisan support for this effort. 
This brings down the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, a universal 
interoperable patient identifier, reducing avoidable administrative 
errors as has been pointed out, and that is being further exacerbated 
by COVID-19 today.
  So we learned during this pandemic that accurate identification of 
patients is one of the most difficult operational issues in the field. 
Field hospitals, temporary testing sites are gathering demographic 
information of patients, but correctly matching that result after they 
return from labs is time-intensive, sometimes inaccurate, and it is a 
burden for the healthcare system.
  I also would make one point, and I have expressed this to my 
colleague, Mr. Foster. We have to do this in a way that protects the 
sensitivity of an individual's medical information and that person's 
right to privacy cannot be compromised. So we need to be firm, clear on 
that principle. I think it can be developed in a way that doesn't 
compromise right-to-privacy.

  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. Kelly), my colleague, for cosponsoring this bipartisan amendment 
so that we can move our healthcare system into the 21st century, save 
money, and, most importantly, save lives.
  Madam Speaker, this amendment is supported by over 50 health groups, 
including the American Heart Association, the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, 
the American College of Surgeons, the College of Healthcare Information 
Management Executives, the Opioid Safety Alliance, and many others.
  Madam Speaker, last year, the House resoundingly passed this 
amendment to strike this ban. I urge my colleagues to once again pass 
this amendment. I urge the Senate to take proper action when we do, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. Foster).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


                 Amendment No. 334 Offered by Mr. Posey

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
334 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 954, line 4, after the dollar amount, insert 
     ``(increased by $2,000,000) (reduced by $2,000,000)''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
  Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, residents and local businesses along the 
way have expressed concerns about the upcoming high-speed rail project 
being built along Florida's east coast and through my district.
  A high number of fatalities have already been associated with the 
train since the South Florida operations began in 2018. In fact, over 
the past 3 years, 75 deaths have been reported along the rail corridor, 
with more than 40 deaths involving the new high-speed train.
  Last year, the Associated Press analyzed data from the Federal 
Railroad Administration and concluded that the project had ``the worst 
per-mile death rate of the Nation's 821 railroads.''
  These trains will travel at fast speeds through existing town centers 
and residential areas in my district, with little separating the tracks 
from the surrounding communities. I have had concern for local schools 
in my district. There are several that are positioned very close or 
adjacent to the tracks; Gifford Middle School and North County 
Elementary School in Vero Beach, and Ascension Catholic School in 
Melbourne, just to name a couple of them. Many students walking to and 
from school must cross these tracks, and we all have an interest in 
their safety.
  Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague, Congressman 
Brian Mast, for working together with me on this amendment, and for 
standing up for the safety of our constituents. Our amendment simply 
asks the Federal Railroad Administration and the Federal Highway 
Administration to conduct a pedestrian, motorist, and student safety 
study along the corridor and report back their recommendations to 
increase safety. The amendment simply increases the FRA's rail safety 
operations budget by $2 million from the program's reserve funds.
  My office reached out to both the FRA and the FHWA for technical 
assistance on doing such a study, and neither agency expressed any 
objection whatsoever. In fact, FRA expressed support for it.
  Staff from both the minority and the majority offices assisted in 
drafting this amendment, and I sincerely want to thank them for working 
together and stepping up to help on this.
  The rail corridor is the recipient of Federal money and has been 
authorized for private activity bonds, so the Federal Government has 
been involved in the funding and financing of this project. Since 
Federal resources are being expended, it only makes sense that we 
should make sure it is safe for the surrounding communities.

[[Page H4173]]

  The introduction of high-speed rail for our Florida communities will 
undoubtedly present safety challenges that need to be properly 
addressed, and that is the purpose of this amendment.
  I ask my colleagues to join us in looking out for the safety of our 
residents, motorists, and school children, and support our amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in 
opposition, although I want to support the bill, if that is acceptable.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast).
  Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me the 
time.
  Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of my colleague. I rise in 
support of my colleague, Mr. Posey's amendment, specifically because 
what is going on with Virgin Trains and Brightline, it affects my 
community as well.
  This project, it goes through some very dense communities with very 
little room between it and the people who live there. Hundreds of the 
crossings that we have that go through our community, nearly all of 
them, are at grade, directly encountering the traffic that they travel 
so close to. There are several schools in close proximity to the rail 
tracks, often placing children in significant danger of this project.
  This amendment, which I am very proud to cosponsor, would divert $2 
million from the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan 
program for a study on pedestrian safety related to this project--very 
worthy cause.
  This is a commonsense, public safety provision that will help to keep 
children and people in our community safe.
  Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this 
amendment.
  Madam Speaker, the rail safety issues that our colleagues raise are 
not limited to the State of Florida. They are severe in Florida, but 
they are, in fact, national problems.
  Communities across the country are working to address highway-rail 
grade crossing safety, to prevent trespassing on railroad rights-of-
way, and to mitigate blocked railroad crossings. In fact, the two 
leading causes of all rail-related fatalities are collisions at 
highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad rights-of-way.
  This bill will provide communities and the Federal Railroad 
Administration with tools to mitigate these safety risks and to develop 
local solutions--specifically:
  $110 million in grants for highway-rail grade crossing improvement 
projects;
  $25 million for capital projects and engineering solutions targeting 
trespassing;
  $10 million to continue media campaigns focused on grade crossing 
safety;
  And $3.6 million for FRA to develop risk models, bolster community 
outreach and education, and support enforcement grants.
  In addition, the bill requires FRA to continue to update each year 
its national strategy to prevent trespassing on railroad property, so 
we can have the most current data available and better understand the 
progress being made or the challenges that remain in reducing 
trespasser fatalities.
  Madam Speaker, I commend my colleagues for offering this amendment, 
for calling attention to this issue, and I pledge to continue to work 
with them as we address railroad safety.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the

               Amendment No. 335 Offered by Ms. Sherrill

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
335 printed in House Report 116-461.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 954, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert 
     ``(reduced by $5,000,000) (increased by $5,000,000)''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Jersey.
  Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about an issue critical to the 
residents of New Jersey.
  I applaud Chairwoman Lowey, Chairman Price, and the Appropriations 
Committee for this important legislation, which includes significant 
new investments in transit to modernize our crumbling bridges and 
tunnels and will jump-start our economy, create jobs, and improve the 
quality of life for New Jersey commuters.
  My amendment demonstrates the strong support this bill provides for 
the Gateway tunnel project and other important rail projects throughout 
the Nation.
  Of great importance to New Jersey is this legislation's focus on new 
rail infrastructure investment, including renewed funding for Amtrak's 
Northeast Corridor, the Capital Investment Grants program, and the 
State of Good Repair Grants program.
  The Nation's most critical surface infrastructure project is the 
Gateway tunnel project. A failure of the current Hudson River tunnels 
could send the Nation into an even greater recession and cost the 
economy an estimated $100 million a day.
  A planned, partial closure of the existing Hudson River tunnel could 
wipe out $22 billion in property values in New Jersey alone.
  New Jersey and the Nation need funding to build Gateway and 
revitalize the similarly outdated transportation infrastructure across 
the country.
  In May of 2019, I testified in front of the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee about the desperate need for a dedicated 
source of passenger rail capital funding that could be used to expedite 
the funding process for large projects like Gateway.
  One program that can fill this important role is the Federal Railroad 
Administration's Northeast Corridor grant program for Amtrak, which 
provides funding for capital projects to expand passenger rail capacity 
and reliability along the most heavily used rail line in the Nation. 
This legislation provides almost $1.2 billion for this program, a 
significant step in expediting funding for the Gateway project.
  Another important program for this task is the Federal Safe 
Partnership for State of Good Repair program, which provides funding to 
rehabilitate rail infrastructure and improve passenger rail 
performance.
  A critical barrier to moving the Gateway project forward has been the 
administration's flawed interpretation of State of Good Repair funding 
as only being available to infrastructure projects in the construction 
phase. That is in spite of the fact that the FAST Act of 2015, which 
created the program, intended the funding to also go toward projects in 
the planning and review phases.
  I sent a letter to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
last year, urging that their surface transportation bill include 
language that explicitly allows projects in the design, planning, and 
review stages to be eligible for State of Good Repair grants. I was 
greatly pleased to see this exact language included in this 
legislation. It is an important step that will help expedite the 
funding that is available for Gateway.
  It is concerning that even when the administration has approved 
grants for Gateway, it has slow-walked that process and continuously 
made grant awards months after they were expected. As a result, the 
entire process for utilizing those funds to conduct planning, reviews, 
and construction has been delayed for long periods.
  This legislation requires that for both the State of Good Repair 
program

[[Page H4174]]

and the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements 
program, the Department of Transportation issue notices about the 
availability of funds and provide those funds within a set period of 
time after this bill goes into effect, which will stop DOT from slow-
walking this important process.
  Finally, the Federal Transit Administration currently requires that a 
project receive a medium or higher rating before it finalizes an 
environmental impact statement that is critical for that project to 
move forward but often then refuses to grant Gateway projects that 
rating. This bill prohibits the FTA from making this requirement for 
the environmental impact statement.
  We have a tremendous opportunity to green-light funding for the 
critical rail projects of the future with smart investments now.
  I thank Chairwoman Lowey and the committee for the great work they 
have done with this legislation, and I hope we can pass this bill that 
is so important for the residents of New Jersey and the Nation.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in 
opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this amendment. The 
Federal-State partnership for State of Good Repair Competitive Grant 
program is vital to improving passenger rail infrastructure all along 
Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and across the Nation.
  I have traveled firsthand to see the Portal Bridge, the Hudson 
tunnels, the other infrastructure on the Northeast Corridor that we 
must upgrade as part of the critical Gateway program. This corridor is 
significant not just to New York, not just to New Jersey, but to the 
entire Nation's economy.
  At the request of my colleague from New Jersey--whose amendment I 
commend--and others from the region, this bill includes important new 
flexibilities in the program which should help jump-start rail 
projects.
  The bill rejects the administration's flawed decision to restrict 
project eligibility to final design and construction activities and 
makes important early-stage project activities like design, 
engineering, environmental studies, and acquiring rights of way 
eligible for funding.
  Given the strain the coronavirus pandemic has placed on the budgets 
of State and local governments, Amtrak, and others, the bill eliminates 
the selection preference for projects which have a 50 percent or higher 
non-Federal match.
  The bill also provides strong funding through other programs which 
could advance the rail infrastructure projects that make up the Gateway 
program, including $5.75 billion for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, $7.2 
billion for Capital Investment Grants (CIGs), $5.5 billion for CRISI, 
and $4 billion for the BUILD program.
  In addition, the bill directs the administration to administer the 
CIG program as required by law, including a prohibition on requiring 
that certain financial metrics be met for projects before they finalize 
environmental reviews.
  So I commend my colleague for her amendment. I look forward to 
working with her and others with a strong interest in this matter to 
support investments in Gateway and other important rail infrastructure 
all across this country.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1067, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).
  The question is on the amendment.
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of H.R. 7617 is postponed.
