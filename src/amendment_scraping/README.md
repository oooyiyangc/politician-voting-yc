# Amendments Scraping
This folder contains all the relevant code used for amendment scraping. 

The main script is `scrape.py`, which calls the classes and the class methods defined in `scrape_amendments.py` and `scrape_amendments_text.py`. To run the code, you need to have `selenium` (with a ChromeDriver), `beautifulsoup`, and other typical data science packages installed.
